I have seen\nnothing.\n  Mar.\nHoratio says\n'tis but our\nfantasy,\n    And\nwill not let\nbelief take hold of\nhim\nTouching this dreaded\nsight,\ntwice seen of us.\nTherefore I\nhave entreated him\nalong,\nWith us to watch\nthe minutes of\nthis night,\nThat, if again this\napparition\ncome,\n    He may\napprove our\neyes and speak to\nit.\n  Hor.\nTush, tush, 'twill\nnot appear.\nBer. Sit down\nawhile,\n    And\nlet us once\nagain assail your\nears,\n    That\nare so fortified\nagainst our\nstory,\n    What we\ntwo nights\nhave seen.\n  Hor.\nWell, sit we\ndown,\n    And let\nus hear\nBernardo speak of this.\nBer.\nLast night of all,\n    When\nyond\nsame star that's westward\nfrom\nthe pole\n    Had made his\ncourse\nt' illume that part of\nheaven\nWhere now it burns,\nMarcellus\nand myself,\n    The\nbell then\nbeating one-\nEnter Ghost.\nMar. Peace!\nbreak thee off! Look\nwhere it\ncomes again!\n  Ber. In\nthe same\nfigure, like the King\nthat's\ndead.  \n  Mar. Thou art a\nscholar; speak to it, Horatio.\nBer. Looks it not like the King?\nMark it, Horatio.\n  Hor. Most\nlike. It harrows me with fear\nand wonder.\n  Ber. It would be\nspoke to.\n  Mar. Question it,\nHoratio.\n  Hor. What art thou\nthat usurp'st this time of night\nTogether with that fair and\nwarlike form\n    In which the\nmajesty of buried Denmark\nDid\nsometimes march? By heaven I\ncharge thee speak!\n  Mar. It is\noffended.\n  Ber. See, it stalks\naway!\n  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak!\nI charge thee speak!\nExit Ghost.\nMar. 'Tis gone and\nwill not\nanswer.\n  Ber. How now,\nHoratio?\nYou tremble and look\npale.\nIs not this something\nmore than\nfantasy?\n    What\nthink you\non't?\n  Hor. Before my\nGod, I\nmight not this believe\nWithout\nthe sensible and true\navouch\nOf mine own eyes.\nMar. Is it not\nlike the King?\nHor. As thou art\nto thyself.\nSuch was the very\narmour he had\non\n    When he th'\nambitious\nNorway combated.\nSo frown'd\nhe once when, in an\nangry parle,\nHe smote the\nsledded Polacks on\nthe ice.\n'Tis strange.\nMar. Thus twice\nbefore, and jump\nat this dead\nhour,\n    With\nmartial stalk\nhath he gone by\nour watch.\nHor. In what\nparticular thought\nto work I\nknow not;\n    But, in\nthe gross\nand scope of my\nopinion,\nThis bodes some strange\neruption\nto our state.\n  Mar.\nGood now,\nsit down, and tell me\nhe that\nknows,\n    Why this same\nstrict\nand most observant watch\nSo\nnightly toils the subject of\nthe\nland,\n    And why such daily\ncast of brazen cannon\n    And\nforeign mart for implements of\nwar;\n    Why such impress of\nshipwrights, whose sore task\nDoes not divide the Sunday from\nthe week.\n    What might be\ntoward, that this sweaty haste\nDoth make the night joint-\nlabourer with the day?\n    Who\nis't that can inform me?\n  Hor.\nThat can I.\n    At least, the\nwhisper goes so. Our last king,\nWhose image even but now\nappear'd to us,\n    Was, as you\nknow, by Fortinbras of Norway,\nThereto prick'd on by a most\nemulate pride,\n    Dar'd to the\ncombat; in which our valiant\nHamlet\n    (For so this side of\nour known world esteem'd him)\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who,\nby a seal'd compact,\n    Well\nratified by law and heraldry,\nDid forfeit, with his life, all\nthose his lands\n    Which he\nstood seiz'd of, to the\nconqueror;\n    Against the which\na moiety competent\n    Was gaged\nby our king; which had return'd\nTo the inheritance of\nFortinbras,\n    Had he been\nvanquisher, as, by the same\ncomart\n    And carriage of the\narticle design'd,\n    His fell\nto Hamlet. Now, sir, young\nFortinbras,\n    Of unimproved\nmettle hot and full,  \n    Hath\nin the skirts of Norway, here\nand there,\n    Shark'd up a list\nof lawless resolutes,\n    For\nfood and diet, to some\nenterprise\n    That hath a\nstomach in't; which is no other,\nAs it doth well appear unto our\nstate,\n    But to recover of us,\nby strong hand\n    And terms\ncompulsatory, those foresaid\nlands\n    So by his father lost;\nand this, I take it,\n    Is the\nmain motive of our preparations,\nThe source of this our watch,\nand the chief head\n    Of this\npost-haste and romage in the\nland.\n  Ber. I think it be no\nother but e'en so.\n    Well may\nit sort that this portentous\nfigure\n    Comes armed through\nour watch, so like the King\nThat\nwas and is the question of\nthese\nwars.\n  Hor. A mote it is\nto\ntrouble the mind's eye.\nIn the\nmost high and palmy state\nof\nRome,\n    A little ere the\nmightiest Julius fell,\n    The\ngraves stood tenantless, and the\nsheeted dead\n    Did squeak and\ngibber in the Roman streets;\nAs\nstars with trains of fire,\nand\ndews of blood,\n    Disasters\nin\nthe sun; and the moist star\nUpon\nwhose influence Neptune's\nempire\nstands\n    Was sick\nalmost to\ndoomsday with eclipse.\nAnd even\nthe like precurse of\nfierce\nevents,\n    As harbingers\npreceding still the fates\nAnd\nprologue to the omen coming\non,\nHave heaven and earth\ntogether\ndemonstrated\n    Unto\nour\nclimature and countrymen.\nEnter\nGhost again.\n\n    But\nsoft!\nbehold! Lo, where it comes\nagain!\n    I'll cross it, though\nit blast me.- Stay illusion!\nSpreads his arms.\n    If thou\nhast any sound, or use of voice,\nSpeak to me.\n    If there be any\ngood thing to be done,\n    That\nmay to thee do ease, and, race\nto me,\n    Speak to me.  \n    If\nthou art privy to thy country's\nfate,\n    Which happily\nforeknowing may avoid,\n    O,\nspeak!\n    Or if thou hast\nuphoarded in thy life\nExtorted\ntreasure in the womb of\nearth\n(For which, they say,\nyou\nspirits oft walk in death),\nThe\ncock crows.\n    Speak of it!\nStay, and speak!- Stop it,\nMarcellus!\n  Mar. Shall I strike\nat it with my partisan?\n  Hor.\nDo, if it will not stand.\n  Ber.\n'Tis here!\n  Hor. 'Tis here!\nMar. 'Tis gone!\nExit Ghost.\nWe do it wrong,\nbeing so\nmajestical,\n    To\noffer it the\nshow of violence;\nFor it is as\nthe air,\ninvulnerable,\n    And\nour vain\nblows malicious\nmockery.\n  Ber.\nIt was about to\nspeak, when the\ncock crew.\nHor. And then it\nstarted, like a\nguilty thing\nUpon a fearful\nsummons. I have\nheard\n    The\ncock, that is the\ntrumpet to the\nmorn,\n    Doth\nwith his lofty\nand shrill-\nsounding throat\nAwake the\ngod of day; and at his\nwarning,\nWhether in sea or fire,\nin earth\nor air,\n    Th'\nextravagant and\nerring spirit\nhies\n    To his\nconfine; and of\nthe truth herein\nThis present\nobject made\nprobation.\n  Mar. It\nfaded on\nthe crowing of the\ncock.\nSome say that ever,\n'gainst that\nseason comes\nWherein our\nSaviour's birth is\ncelebrated,\nThe bird of dawning\nsingeth all\nnight long;\n    And\nthen, they\nsay, no spirit dare\nstir abroad,\nThe nights are\nwholesome, then\nno planets\nstrike,\n    No fairy\ntakes, nor\nwitch hath power to\ncharm,\nSo hallow'd and so\ngracious is\nthe time.\n  Hor. So\nhave I heard\nand do in part\nbelieve it.\nBut look, the\nmorn, in russet\nmantle clad,\nWalks o'er the dew\nof yon high\neastward hill.\nBreak we our\nwatch up; and by my\nadvice\nLet us impart what we\nhave seen\nto-night\n    Unto\nyoung Hamlet;\nfor, upon my life,\nThis\nspirit, dumb to us, will\nspeak\nto him.\n    Do you consent\nwe\nshall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting\nour duty?\n    Let's do't, I\npray; and I this morning know\nWhere we shall find him most\nconveniently.           Exeunt.\nScene II.\nElsinore. A room of\nstate in the Castle.\n\nFlourish.\n[Enter Claudius, King of\nDenmark, Gertrude the Queen,\nHamlet,\nPolonius, Laertes and\nhis sister Ophelia, [Voltemand,\nCornelius,]\nLords Attendant.\nKing. Though yet of Hamlet our\ndear brother's death\n    The\nmemory be green, and that it us\nbefitted\n    To bear our hearts\nin grief, and our whole kingdom\nTo be contracted in one brow of\nwoe,\n    Yet so far hath\ndiscretion fought with nature\nThat we with wisest sorrow think\non him\n    Together with\nremembrance of ourselves.\nTherefore our sometime sister,\nnow our queen,\n    Th' imperial\njointress to this warlike state,\nHave we, as 'twere with a\ndefeated joy,\n    With an\nauspicious, and a dropping eye,\nWith mirth in funeral, and with\ndirge in marriage,\n    In equal\nscale weighing delight and dole,\nTaken to wife; nor have we\nherein barr'd\n    Your better\nwisdoms, which have freely gone\nWith this affair along. For all,\nour thanks.\n    Now follows,\nthat you know, young Fortinbras,\nHolding a weak supposal of our\nworth,\n    Or thinking by our\nlate dear brother's death\nOur\nstate to be disjoint and out\nof\nframe,\n    Colleagued with\nthis\ndream of his advantage,\nHe hath\nnot fail'd to pester us\nwith\nmessage\n    Importing the\nsurrender of those lands\nLost by\nhis father, with all\nbands of\nlaw,\n    To our most\nvaliant\nbrother. So much for\nhim.\nNow for ourself and for\nthis\ntime of meeting.\n    Thus\nmuch\nthe business is: we have\nhere\nwrit\n    To Norway, uncle\nof\nyoung Fortinbras,\n    Who,\nimpotent and bedrid, scarcely\nhears\n    Of this his nephew's\npurpose, to suppress\n    His\nfurther gait herein, in that the\nlevies,\n    The lists, and full\nproportions are all made\n    Out\nof his subject; and we here\ndispatch\n    You, good\nCornelius, and you, Voltemand,\nFor bearers of this greeting to\nold Norway,  \n    Giving to you\nno further personal power\n    To\nbusiness with the King, more\nthan the scope\n    Of these\ndilated articles allow.\n[Gives a\npaper.]\n    Farewell,\nand let\nyour haste commend your\nduty.\nCor., Volt. In that, and\nall\nthings, will we show our\nduty.\nKing. We doubt it\nnothing.\nHeartily farewell.\nExeunt\nVoltemand and Cornelius.\nAnd\nnow, Laertes, what's the\nnews\nwith you?\n    You told us\nof\nsome suit. What is't,\nLaertes?\nYou cannot speak of\nreason to\nthe Dane\n    And lose\nyour\nvoice. What wouldst thou\nbeg,\nLaertes,\n    That shall not\nbe\nmy offer, not thy asking?\nThe\nhead is not more native to\nthe\nheart,\n    The hand more\ninstrumental to the mouth,\nThan\nis the throne of Denmark to\nthy\nfather.\n    What wouldst\nthou\nhave, Laertes?\n  Laer. My\ndread\nlord,\n    Your leave and\nfavour\nto return to France;\nFrom whence\nthough willingly I\ncame to\nDenmark\n    To show my\nduty in\nyour coronation,\nYet now I must\nconfess, that\nduty done,\n    My\nthoughts and\nwishes bend again\ntoward France\nAnd bow them to\nyour gracious\nleave and pardon.\nKing. Have\nyou your father's\nleave? What\nsays Polonius?\nPol. He hath,\nmy lord, wrung\nfrom me my slow\nleave\n    By\nlaboursome\npetition, and at last\nUpon\nhis will I seal'd my hard\nconsent.\n    I do beseech you\ngive him leave to go.\n  King.\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes.\nTime be thine,\n    And thy best\ngraces spend it at thy will!\nBut\nnow, my cousin Hamlet, and\nmy\nson-\n  Ham. [aside] A little\nmore than kin, and less than\nkind!\n  King. How is it that the\nclouds still hang on you?\n  Ham.\nNot so, my lord. I am too much\ni' th' sun.\n  Queen. Good\nHamlet, cast thy nighted colour\noff,\n    And let thine eye look\nlike a friend on Denmark.\n    Do\nnot for ever with thy vailed\nlids\n    Seek for thy noble\nfather in the dust.\n    Thou\nknow'st 'tis common. All that\nlives must die,\n    Passing\nthrough nature to eternity.\nHam.\nAy, madam, it is common.\nQueen.\nIf it be,\n    Why seems\nit so\nparticular with thee?\nHam.\nSeems, madam, Nay, it is. I\nknow\nnot 'seems.'\n    'Tis not\nalone\nmy inky cloak, good\nmother,\nNor customary suits\nof solemn\nblack,\n    Nor windy\nsuspiration\nof forc'd breath,\nNo, nor the\nfruitful river in\nthe eye,\nNor the dejected\nhavior of the\nvisage,\nTogether with all forms,\nmoods,\nshapes of grief,\n'That can\ndenote me truly. These\nindeed\nseem,\n    For they are\nactions\nthat a man might play;\nBut I\nhave that within which\npasseth\nshow-\n    These but the\ntrappings and the suits of woe.\nKing. 'Tis sweet and commendable\nin your nature, Hamlet,\n    To\ngive these mourning duties to\nyour father;\n    But you must\nknow, your father lost a father;\nThat father lost, lost his, and\nthe survivor bound\n    In filial\nobligation for some term\n    To\ndo obsequious sorrow. But to\npersever  \n    In obstinate\ncondolement is a course\n    Of\nimpious stubbornness. 'Tis\nunmanly grief;\n    It shows a\nwill most incorrect to heaven,\nA\nheart unfortified, a mind\nimpatient,\n    An understanding\nsimple and unschool'd;\n    For\nwhat we know must be, and is as\ncommon\n    As any the most\nvulgar thing to sense,\n    Why\nshould we in our peevish\nopposition\n    Take it to heart?\nFie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\nA\nfault against the dead, a\nfault\nto nature,\n    To reason\nmost\nabsurd, whose common theme\nIs\ndeath of fathers, and who\nstill\nhath cried,\n    From the\nfirst\ncorse till he that died\nto-day,\n'This must be so.'\nWe pray you\nthrow to earth\nThis unprevailing\nwoe, and think\nof us\n    As of a\nfather; for\nlet the world take\nnote\n    You\nare the most\nimmediate to our\nthrone,\n    And\nwith no less\nnobility of love\nThan that\nwhich dearest father\nbears his\nson\n    Do I impart\ntoward you.\nFor your intent\nIn going\nback to school in\nWittenberg,\nIt is most\nretrograde to our\ndesire;\nAnd we beseech you,\nbend you to\nremain\n    Here in\nthe cheer and\ncomfort of our\neye,\n    Our\nchiefest courtier,\ncousin, and\nour son.\n  Queen.\nLet not thy\nmother lose her\nprayers, Hamlet.\nI pray thee\nstay with us, go not\nto\nWittenberg.\n  Ham. I shall in\nall my best obey you, madam.\nKing. Why, 'tis a loving and a\nfair reply.\n    Be as ourself in\nDenmark. Madam, come.\n    This\ngentle and unforc'd accord of\nHamlet\n    Sits smiling to my\nheart; in grace whereof,\n    No\njocund health that Denmark\ndrinks to-day\n    But the great\ncannon to the clouds shall tell,\nAnd the King's rouse the heaven\nshall bruit again,\nRespeaking\nearthly thunder. Come\naway.\nFlourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.\nHam. O that this too too solid\nflesh would melt,\n    Thaw, and\nresolve itself into a dew!\nOr\nthat the Everlasting had not\nfix'd  \n    His canon 'gainst\nself-slaughter! O God! God!\nHow\nweary, stale, flat, and\nunprofitable\n    Seem to me all\nthe uses of this world!\n    Fie\non't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded\ngarden\n    That grows to seed;\nthings rank and gross in nature\nPossess it merely. That it\nshould come to this!\n    But two\nmonths dead! Nay, not so much,\nnot two.\n    So excellent a\nking, that was to this\nHyperion\nto a satyr; so loving\nto my\nmother\n    That he might\nnot\nbeteem the winds of heaven\nVisit\nher face too roughly.\nHeaven and\nearth!\n    Must I\nremember? Why,\nshe would hang on\nhim\n    As if\nincrease of\nappetite had grown\nBy what\nit fed on; and yet,\nwithin a\nmonth-\n    Let me not\nthink\non't! Frailty, thy name is\nwoman!-\n    A little month, or\nere those shoes were old\nWith\nwhich she followed my poor\nfather's body\n    Like Niobe,\nall tears- why she, even she\n(O\nGod! a beast that wants\ndiscourse of reason\n    Would\nhave mourn'd longer) married\nwith my uncle;  \n    My father's\nbrother, but no more like my\nfather\n    Than I to Hercules.\nWithin a month,\n    Ere yet the\nsalt of most unrighteous tears\nHad left the flushing in her\ngalled eyes,\n    She married. O,\nmost wicked speed, to post\nWith\nsuch dexterity to\nincestuous\nsheets!\n    It is\nnot, nor it\ncannot come to good.\nBut break\nmy heart, for I must\nhold my\ntongue!\n\n          Enter\nHoratio, Marcellus, and\nBernardo.\n\n  Hor. Hail to your\nlordship!\n  Ham. I am glad to\nsee you well.\n    Horatio!- or I\ndo forget myself.\n  Hor. The\nsame, my lord, and your poor\nservant ever.\n  Ham. Sir, my\ngood friend- I'll change that\nname with you.\n    And what make\nyou from Wittenberg, Horatio?\nMarcellus?\n  Mar. My good lord!\nHam. I am very glad to see you.-\n[To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-\nBut what, in faith, make you\nfrom Wittenberg?\n  Hor. A truant\ndisposition, good my lord.\nHam.\nI would not hear your enemy\nsay\nso,\n    Nor shall you do my\near\nthat violence\n    To make it\ntruster of your own report\nAgainst yourself. I know you are\nno truant.\n    But what is your\naffair in Elsinore?\n    We'll\nteach you to drink deep ere you\ndepart.\n  Hor. My lord, I came\nto see your father's funeral.\nHam. I prithee do not mock me,\nfellow student.\n    I think it\nwas to see my mother's wedding.\nHor. Indeed, my lord, it\nfollowed hard upon.\n  Ham.\nThrift, thrift, Horatio! The\nfuneral bak'd meats\n    Did\ncoldly furnish forth the\nmarriage tables.\n    Would I had\nmet my dearest foe in heaven\nOr\never I had seen that day,\nHoratio!\n    My father- methinks\nI see my father.\n  Hor. O,\nwhere, my lord?\n  Ham. In my\nmind's eye, Horatio.\n  Hor. I\nsaw him once. He was a goodly\nking.  \n  Ham. He was a man,\ntake him for all in all.\n    I\nshall not look upon his like\nagain.\n  Hor. My lord, I think I\nsaw him yesternight.\n  Ham. Saw?\nwho?\n  Hor. My lord, the King\nyour father.\n  Ham. The King my\nfather?\n  Hor. Season your\nadmiration for a while\n    With\nan attent ear, till I may\ndeliver\n    Upon the witness of\nthese gentlemen,\n    This marvel\nto you.\n  Ham. For God's love\nlet me hear!\n  Hor. Two nights\ntogether had these gentlemen\n(Marcellus and Bernardo) on\ntheir watch\n    In the dead vast\nand middle of the night\n    Been\nthus encount'red. A figure like\nyour father,\n    Armed at point\nexactly, cap-a-pe,\n    Appears\nbefore them and with solemn\nmarch\n    Goes slow and stately\nby them. Thrice he walk'd\n    By\ntheir oppress'd and fear-\nsurprised eyes,\n    Within his\ntruncheon's length; whilst they\ndistill'd  \n    Almost to jelly\nwith the act of fear,\n    Stand\ndumb and speak not to him. This\nto me\n    In dreadful secrecy\nimpart they did,\n    And I with\nthem the third night kept the\nwatch;\n    Where, as they had\ndeliver'd, both in time,\nForm of\nthe thing, each word\nmade true\nand good,\n    The\napparition\ncomes. I knew your\nfather.\nThese hands are not\nmore like.\nHam. But where was\nthis?\n  Mar.\nMy lord, upon the\nplatform where\nwe watch'd.\nHam. Did you not\nspeak to it?\nHor. My lord, I\ndid;\n    But\nanswer made it\nnone. Yet once\nmethought\n    It\nlifted up it\nhead and did\naddress\n    Itself\nto motion,\nlike as it would\nspeak;\n    But\neven then the\nmorning cock crew\nloud,\n    And\nat the sound it\nshrunk in haste\naway\n    And\nvanish'd from our\nsight.\n  Ham.\n'Tis very strange.\nHor. As I do\nlive, my honour'd\nlord, 'tis\ntrue;  \n    And we\ndid think it\nwrit down in our\nduty\n    To let\nyou know of it.\nHam. Indeed,\nindeed, sirs. But\nthis troubles\nme.\n    Hold you\nthe watch to-\nnight?\n  Both [Mar.\nand Ber.] We\ndo, my lord.\n  Ham.\nArm'd, say\nyou?\n  Both. Arm'd,\nmy lord.\nHam. From top to toe?\nBoth. My\nlord, from head to\nfoot.\n  Ham.\nThen saw you not\nhis face?\nHor. O, yes, my\nlord! He wore\nhis beaver up.\nHam. What, look'd\nhe frowningly.\nHor. A\ncountenance more in\nsorrow than\nin anger.\n  Ham.\nPale or red?\nHor. Nay, very\npale.\n  Ham. And\nfix'd his eyes\nupon you?\n  Hor.\nMost\nconstantly.\n  Ham. I would\nI had\nbeen there.\n  Hor. It\nwould have\nmuch amaz'd you.\nHam. Very\nlike, very like.\nStay'd it long?\nHor. While one\nwith moderate\nhaste might tell a\nhundred.\nBoth. Longer, longer.\nHor. Not\nwhen I saw't.\n  Ham.\nHis beard\nwas grizzled- no?\nHor. It was,\nas I have seen it\nin his life,\nA sable silver'd.\nHam. I will\nwatch to-night.\nPerchance\n'twill walk again.\nHor. I\nwarr'nt it will.\n  Ham.\nIf it\nassume my noble father's\nperson,\nI'll speak to it, though\nhell\nitself should gape\n    And\nbid\nme hold my peace. I pray you\nall,\n    If you have hitherto\nconceal'd this sight,\n    Let it\nbe tenable in your silence\nstill;\n    And whatsoever else\nshall hap to-night,\n    Give it\nan understanding but no tongue.\nI will requite your loves.

No more but so?\nLaer. Think it no more.\n    For\nnature crescent does not grow\nalone\n    In thews and bulk; but\nas this temple waxes,\n    The\ninward service of the mind and\nsoul\n    Grows wide withal.\nPerhaps he loves you now,\nAnd\nnow no soil nor cautel doth\nbesmirch\n    The virtue of his\nwill; but you must fear,\n    His\ngreatness weigh'd, his will is\nnot his own;\n    For he himself\nis subject to his birth.\n    He\nmay not, as unvalued persons do,\nCarve for himself, for on his\nchoice depends\n    The safety\nand health of this whole state,\nAnd therefore must his choice be\ncircumscrib'd\n    Unto the voice\nand yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if\nhe says he loves you,\n    It\nfits your wisdom so far to\nbelieve it\n    As he in his\nparticular act and place\n    May\ngive his saying deed; which is\nno further\n    Than the main\nvoice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour\nmay sustain\n    If with too\ncredent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your\nchaste treasure open\n    To his\nunmast'red importunity.\n    Fear\nit, Ophelia, fear it, my dear\nsister,\n    And keep you in the\nrear of your affection,\nOut of\nthe shot and danger of\ndesire.\nThe chariest maid is\nprodigal\nenough\n    If she\nunmask her\nbeauty to the moon.\nVirtue\nitself scopes not\ncalumnious\nstrokes.\n    The\ncanker galls\nthe infants of the\nspring\nToo oft before their\nbuttons be\ndisclos'd,\n    And in\nthe morn\nand liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most\nimminent.\n    Be wary then; best\nsafety lies in fear.\n    Youth\nto itself rebels, though none\nelse near.\n  Oph. I shall th'\neffect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart.

Marry,\nwell\nbethought!\n    'Tis told me\nhe\nhath very oft of late\nGiven\nprivate time to you, and\nyou\nyourself\n    Have of your\naudience been most free and\nbounteous.\n    If it be so- as\nso 'tis put on me,\n    And that\nin way of caution- I must tell\nyou\n    You do not understand\nyourself so clearly\n    As it\nbehooves my daughter and your\nhonour.\n    What is between you?\nGive me up the truth.\n  Oph. He\nhath, my lord, of late made many\ntenders\n    Of his affection to\nme.\n  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You\nspeak like a green girl,\nUnsifted in such perilous\ncircumstance.\n    Do you believe\nhis tenders, as you call them?\nOph.

Tender yourself more\ndearly,\n    Or (not to crack the\nwind of the poor phrase,\nRunning\nit thus) you'll tender\nme a\nfool.  \n  Oph. My lord, he\nhath\nimportun'd me with love\nIn\nhonourable fashion.\n  Pol.\nAy,\nfashion you may call it. Go\nto,\ngo to!\n  Oph. And hath given\ncountenance to his speech, my\nlord,\n    With almost all the\nholy vows of heaven.\n  Pol. Ay,\nspringes to catch woodcocks! I\ndo know,\n    When the blood\nburns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows. These\nblazes, daughter,\n    Giving\nmore light than heat, extinct in\nboth\n    Even in their promise,\nas it is a-making,\n    You must\nnot take for fire. From this\ntime\n    Be something scanter of\nyour maiden presence.\n    Set\nyour entreatments at a higher\nrate\n    Than a command to\nparley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve\nso much in him, that he\nis\nyoung,\n    And with a larger\ntether may he walk\n    Than may\nbe given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for\nthey are brokers,\n    Not of\nthat dye which their investments\nshow,\n    But mere implorators\nof unholy suits,  \n    Breathing\nlike sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is\nfor all:\n    I would not, in\nplain terms, from this time\nforth\n    Have you so slander\nany moment leisure\n    As to\ngive words or talk with the Lord\nHamlet.\n    Look to't, I charge\nyou.

It is a nipping\nand an\neager air.\n  Ham. What\nhour now?\nHor. I think it lacks\nof twelve.\nMar. No, it is\nstruck.\n  Hor.\nIndeed? I heard\nit not. It then\ndraws near the\nseason\nWherein the spirit held\nhis wont\nto walk.\nA\nflourish of trumpets, and two\npieces go off.\n    What does\nthis mean, my lord?\n  Ham. The\nKing doth wake to-night and\ntakes his rouse,\n    Keeps\nwassail, and the swagg'ring\nupspring reels,\n    And, as he\ndrains his draughts of Rhenish\ndown,\n    The kettledrum and\ntrumpet thus bray out\n    The\ntriumph of his pledge.\n  Hor. Is\nit a custom?\n  Ham. Ay, marry,\nis't;\n    But to my mind, though\nI am native here  \n    And to\nthe manner born, it is a custom\nMore honour'd in the breach than\nthe observance.\n    This heavy-\nheaded revel east and west\nMakes\nus traduc'd and tax'd of\nother\nnations;\n    They clip us\ndrunkards and with swinish\nphrase\n    Soil our addition;\nand indeed it takes\n    From our\nachievements, though perform'd\nat height,\n    The pith and\nmarrow of our attribute.\n    So\noft it chances in particular men\nThat, for some vicious mole of\nnature in them,\n    As in their\nbirth,- wherein they are not\nguilty,\n    Since nature cannot\nchoose his origin,-\n    By the\no'ergrowth of some complexion,\nOft breaking down the pales and\nforts of reason,\n    Or by some\nhabit that too much o'erleavens\nThe form of plausive manners,\nthat these men\n    Carrying, I\nsay, the stamp of one defect,\nBeing nature's livery, or\nfortune's star,\n    Their\nvirtues else- be they as pure as\ngrace,\n    As infinite as man\nmay undergo-  \n    Shall in the\ngeneral censure take corruption\nFrom that particular fault.

No, by\nno means!\nHam. It will not\nspeak. Then\nwill I follow it.\nHor. Do not,\nmy lord!\n  Ham.\nWhy, what should\nbe the fear?\nI do not set my\nlife at a pin's\nfee;\n    And for\nmy soul, what\ncan it do to that,\nBeing a thing\nimmortal as\nitself?  \n    It\nwaves me forth\nagain.

Haste me to\nknow't, that I, with wings as\nswift\n    As meditation or the\nthoughts of love,\n    May sweep\nto my revenge.\n  Ghost.

So did\nit mine;\n    And a most instant\ntetter bark'd about,  \n    Most\nlazar-like, with vile and\nloathsome crust\n    All my\nsmooth body.\n    Thus was I,\nsleeping, by a brother's hand\nOf\nlife, of crown, of queen, at\nonce dispatch'd;\n    Cut off\neven in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhous'led, disappointed,\nunanel'd,\n    No reckoning made,\nbut sent to my account\n    With\nall my imperfections on my head.\nHam. O, horrible! O, horrible!\nmost horrible!\n  Ghost. If thou\nhast nature in thee, bear it\nnot.\n    Let not the royal bed\nof Denmark be\n    A couch for\nluxury and damned incest.\nBut,\nhowsoever thou pursuest\nthis\nact,\n    Taint not thy\nmind, nor\nlet thy soul contrive\nAgainst\nthy mother aught.

'And in part\nhim, but,' you may say, 'not\nwell.\n    But if't be he I mean,\nhe's very wild\n    Addicted so\nand so'; and there put on him\nWhat forgeries you please;\nmarry, none so rank\n    As may\ndishonour him- take heed of\nthat;\n    But, sir, such wanton,\nwild, and usual slips\n    As are\ncompanions noted and most known\nTo youth and liberty.\n  Rey.

My lord,\nthat would dishonour him.\n  Pol.\nFaith, no, as you may season it\nin the charge.\n    You must not\nput another scandal on him,\nThat\nhe is open to incontinency.\nThat's not my meaning. But\nbreathe his faults so quaintly\nThat they may seem the taints of\nliberty,\n    The flash and\noutbreak of a fiery mind,\n    A\nsavageness in unreclaimed blood,\nOf general assault.  \n  Rey.\nBut, my good lord-\n  Pol.\nWherefore should you do this?\nRey. Ay, my lord,\n    I would\nknow that.\n  Pol. Marry, sir,\nhere's my drift,\n    And I\nbelieve it is a fetch of\nwarrant.\n    You laying these\nslight sullies on my son\n    As\n'twere a thing a little soil'd\ni' th' working,\n    Mark you,\nYour party in converse, him you\nwould sound,\n    Having ever\nseen in the prenominate crimes\nThe youth you breathe of guilty,\nbe assur'd\n    He closes with\nyou in this consequence:\n'Good\nsir,' or so, or 'friend,'\nor\n'gentleman'-\n    According to\nthe phrase or the addition\nOf\nman and country-\n  Rey. Very\ngood, my lord.\n  Pol. And then,\nsir, does 'a this- 'a does- What\nwas I about to say?\n    By the\nmass, I was about to say\nsomething! Where did I leave?\nRey. At 'closes in the\nconsequence,' at 'friend or so,'\nand  \n    gentleman.'\n  Pol. At\n'closes in the consequence'- Ay,\nmarry!\n    He closes thus: 'I\nknow the gentleman.\n    I saw\nhim yesterday, or t'other day,\nOr then, or then, with such or\nsuch; and, as you say,\n    There\nwas 'a gaming; there o'ertook\nin's rouse;\n    There falling\nout at tennis'; or perchance,\n'I\nsaw him enter such a house of\nsale,'\n    Videlicet, a brothel,\nor so forth.\n    See you now-\nYour bait of falsehood takes\nthis carp of truth;\n    And thus\ndo we of wisdom and of reach,\nWith windlasses and with assays\nof bias,\n    By indirections\nfind directions out.\n    So, by\nmy former lecture and advice,\nShall you my son.

Mad for thy love?  \n  Oph.\nMy lord, I do not know,\n    But\ntruly I do fear it.\n  Pol. What\nsaid he?\n  Oph.

You are a fishmonger.\nPol.\nNot I, my lord.\n  Ham. Then\nI\nwould you were so honest a\nman.\nPol. Honest, my lord?\nHam. Ay,\nsir. To be honest, as\nthis world\ngoes, is to be one\nman\npick'd out of ten\nthousand.\nPol. That's very\ntrue, my lord.\nHam. For if the\nsun breed\nmaggots in a dead dog,\nbeing a\ngod  \n    kissing\ncarrion- Have\nyou a daughter?\nPol. I have, my\nlord.\n  Ham. Let\nher not walk i'\nth' sun.\nConception is a\nblessing, but\nnot\n    as your\ndaughter may\nconceive. Friend,\nlook to't.\nPol. [aside] How say\nyou by\nthat? Still harping on my\ndaughter. Yet\n    he knew me not\nat first. He said I was a\nfishmonger. He is far\n    gone,\nfar gone! And truly in my youth\nI suff'red much extremity\nfor\nlove- very near this. I'll\nspeak\nto him again.- What do you\nread,\nmy lord?\n  Ham. Words,\nwords,\nwords.\n  Pol. What is the\nmatter, my lord?\n  Ham. Between\nwho?\n  Pol. I mean, the matter\nthat you read, my lord.\n  Ham.\nSlanders, sir; for the satirical\nrogue says here that old men\nhave grey beards; that their\nfaces are wrinkled; their eyes\npurging thick amber and plum-\ntree gum; and that they have a\nplentiful lack of wit, together\nwith most weak hams. All which,\nsir, though I most powerfully\nand potently believe, yet I hold\nit\n    not honesty to have it\nthus set down; for you yourself,\nsir,\n    should be old as I am\nif, like a crab, you could go\nbackward.  \n  Pol.

I\n    will\nleave\nhim and suddenly contrive\nthe\nmeans of meeting between\nhim and\nmy daughter.- My\nhonourable\nlord, I will most\nhumbly take\nmy leave of you.\nHam. You\ncannot, sir, take from\nme\nanything that I will more\nwillingly part withal- except my\nlife, except my life, except my\nlife,\n\n                    Enter\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern.\nPol. Fare you well, my lord.\nHam. These tedious old fools!\nPol. You go to seek the Lord\nHamlet. There he is.\n  Ros. [to\nPolonius] God save you, sir!\nExit [Polonius].  \n  Guil. My\nhonour'd lord!\n  Ros. My most\ndear lord!\n  Ham. My excellent\ngood friends! How dost thou,\nGuildenstern? Ah,\nRosencrantz!\nGood lads, how do\nye both?\nRos. As the\nindifferent children\nof the\nearth.\n  Guil. Happy in\nthat we\nare not over-happy.\nOn\nFortune's cap we are not the\nvery button.\n  Ham. Nor the\nsoles of her shoe?\n  Ros.\nNeither, my lord.\n  Ham. Then\nyou live about her waist, or in\nthe middle of her\n    favours?\nGuil. Faith, her privates we.\nHam. In the secret parts of\nFortune? O! most true! she is a\nstrumpet. What news ?\n  Ros.\nNone, my lord, but that the\nworld's grown honest.\n  Ham.\nThen is doomsday near! But your\nnews is not true. Let me\nquestion more in particular.\nWhat have you, my good friends,\ndeserved at the hands of Fortune\nthat she sends you to prison\nhither?\n  Guil. Prison, my lord?\nHam. Denmark's a prison.\n  Ros.\nThen is the world one.\n  Ham. A\ngoodly one; in which there are\nmany confines, wards, and\ndungeons, Denmark being one o'\nth' worst.\n  Ros. We think not\nso, my lord.\n  Ham. Why, then\n'tis none to you; for there is\nnothing either good\n    or bad\nbut thinking makes it so. To me\nit is a prison.\n  Ros. Why, then\nyour ambition makes it one. 'Tis\ntoo narrow for your\n    mind.\nHam. O God, I could be bounded\nin a nutshell and count myself a\nking of infinite space, were it\nnot that I have bad dreams.\nGuil. Which dreams indeed are\nambition; for the very substance\nof\n    the ambitious is merely\nthe shadow of a dream.\n  Ham. A\ndream itself is but a shadow.\nRos. Truly, and I hold ambition\nof so airy and light a quality\nthat\n    it is but a shadow's\nshadow.\n  Ham. Then are our\nbeggars bodies, and our monarchs\nand outstretch'd\n    heroes the\nbeggars' shadows. Shall we to\nth' court? for, by my\n    fay, I\ncannot reason.\n  Both. We'll\nwait upon you.  \n  Ham. No such\nmatter! I will not sort you with\nthe rest of my\n    servants;\nfor, to speak to you like an\nhonest man, I am most\ndreadfully\nattended. But in the\nbeaten way\nof friendship, what\nmake you at\nElsinore?\n  Ros. To\nvisit you,\nmy lord; no other\noccasion.\nHam. Beggar that I\nam, I am even\npoor in thanks;\nbut I thank you;\nand sure,\ndear friends, my\nthanks are too\ndear a halfpenny.\nWere\n    you\nnot sent for? Is it\nyour own\ninclining? Is it a free\nvisitation? Come, deal justly\nwith me. Come, come! Nay, speak.\nGuil. What should we say, my\nlord?\n  Ham. Why, anything- but\nto th' purpose. You were sent\nfor; and\n    there is a kind of\nconfession in your looks, which\nyour modesties\n    have not\ncraft enough to colour. I know\nthe good King and Queen\n    have\nsent for you.\n  Ros. To what\nend, my lord?\n  Ham. That you\nmust teach me. But let me\nconjure you by the rights\n    of\nour fellowship, by the\nconsonancy of our youth, by the\nobligation of our ever-preserved\nlove, and by what more dear a\nbetter proposer could charge you\nwithal, be even and direct with\nme, whether you were sent for or\nno.  \n  Ros. [aside to\nGuildenstern] What say you?\nHam.\n[aside] Nay then, I have an\neye\nof you.- If you love me,\nhold\nnot off.\n  Guil. My\nlord, we\nwere sent for.\n  Ham. I\nwill\ntell you why. So shall my\nanticipation prevent your\ndiscovery, and your secrecy to\nthe King and Queen moult no\nfeather. I have of late- but\nwherefore I know not- lost all\nmy\n    mirth, forgone all custom\nof exercises; and indeed, it\ngoes so\n    heavily with my\ndisposition that this goodly\nframe, the earth,\n    seems to\nme a sterile promontory; this\nmost excellent canopy, the\nair,\nlook you, this brave\no'erhanging\nfirmament, this\nmajestical\nroof fretted with\ngolden fire-\nwhy, it appeareth\nno other thing\nto me than a\nfoul and pestilent\ncongregation\nof vapours. What a\npiece of\nwork is a man! how\nnoble in\nreason! how infinite in\nfaculties! in form and moving\nhow express and admirable! in\naction how like an angel! in\napprehension how like a god! the\nbeauty of the world, the paragon\nof animals! And yet to me what\nis this quintessence of dust?\nMan delights not me- no, nor\nwoman\n    neither, though by\nyour smiling you seem to say so.\nRos. My lord, there was no such\nstuff in my thoughts.  \n  Ham.\nWhy did you laugh then, when I\nsaid 'Man delights not me'?\nRos.\nTo think, my lord, if you\ndelight not in man, what lenten\nentertainment the players shall\nreceive from you. We coted them\non the way, and hither are they\ncoming to offer you service.\nHam. He that plays the king\nshall be welcome- his Majesty\nshall\n    have tribute of me;\nthe adventurous knight shall use\nhis foil and\n    target; the\nlover shall not sigh gratis; the\nhumorous man shall\n    end his\npart in peace; the clown shall\nmake those laugh whose\n    lungs\nare tickle o' th' sere; and the\nlady shall say her mind\nfreely,\nor the blank verse shall\nhalt\nfort. What players are\nthey?\nRos. Even those you were\nwont to\ntake such delight in,\nthe\ntragedians of the city.\nHam. How\nchances it they travel?\nTheir\nresidence, both in\nreputation\nand profit, was\nbetter both\nways.\n  Ros. I think\ntheir\ninhibition comes by the\nmeans of\nthe late\ninnovation.\n  Ham. Do\nthey hold\nthe same estimation\nthey did\nwhen I was in the\ncity? Are\nthey so follow'd?\nRos. No\nindeed are they not.\nHam.\nHow comes it? Do they grow\nrusty?\n  Ros. Nay, their\nendeavour keeps in the wonted\npace; but there is,\n    sir, an\neyrie of children, little\neyases, that cry out on the top\nof question and are most\ntyrannically clapp'd fort.

What if this cursed\nhand\n    Were thicker than\nitself with brother's blood,\nIs\nthere not rain enough in the\nsweet heavens\n    To wash it\nwhite as snow? Whereto serves\nmercy\n    But to confront the\nvisage of offence?\n    And\nwhat's in prayer but this\ntwofold force,\n    To be\nforestalled ere we come to fall,\nOr pardon'd being down? Then\nI'll look up;\n    My fault is\npast. But, O, what form of\nprayer\n    Can serve my turn?\n'Forgive me my foul murther'?\nThat cannot be; since I am still\npossess'd\n    Of those effects\nfor which I did the murther-\nMy\ncrown, mine own ambition, and\nmy\nqueen.\n    May one be\npardon'd\nand retain th' offence?\nIn the\ncorrupted currents of\nthis world\nOffence's gilded\nhand may shove\nby justice,\nAnd oft 'tis seen\nthe wicked\nprize itself\n    Buys\nout the\nlaw; but 'tis not so\nabove.\nThere is no shuffling;\nthere the\naction lies\n    In his\ntrue\nnature, and we ourselves\ncompell'd,\n    Even to the teeth\nand forehead of our faults,\nTo\ngive in evidence. What then?\nWhat rests?\n    Try what\nrepentance can. What can it not?\nYet what can it when one cannot\nrepent?\n    O wretched state! O\nbosom black as death!\n    O\nlimed soul, that, struggling to\nbe free,\n    Art more engag'd!\nHelp, angels! Make assay.\nBow,\nstubborn knees; and heart\nwith\nstrings of steel,\n    Be\nsoft as\nsinews of the new-born\nbabe!\nAll may be well.\nHe kneels.\nEnter Hamlet.\n\n  Ham. Now might\nI do it pat, now he is praying;\nAnd now I'll do't. And so he\ngoes to heaven,\n    And so am I\nreveng'd. That would be scann'd.\nA villain kills my father; and\nfor that,\n    I, his sole son,\ndo this same villain send\n    To\nheaven.\n    Why, this is hire\nand salary, not revenge!\n    He\ntook my father grossly, full of\nbread,\n    With all his crimes\nbroad blown, as flush as May;\nAnd how his audit stands, who\nknows save heaven?\n    But in\nour circumstance and course of\nthought,\n    'Tis heavy with\nhim; and am I then reveng'd,\nTo\ntake him in the purging of\nhis\nsoul,\n    When he is fit and\nseasoned for his passage?\nNo.\nUp, sword, and know thou\na more\nhorrid hent.\n    When he\nis\ndrunk asleep; or in his rage;\nOr\nin th' incestuous pleasure of\nhis bed;\n    At gaming,\nswearing, or about some act\nThat\nhas no relish of salvation\nin't-\nThen trip him, that\nhis heels\nmay kick at heaven,\nAnd that his\nsoul may be as\ndamn'd and black\nAs hell,\nwhereto it goes. My\nmother\nstays.\n    This physic\nbut\nprolongs thy sickly days.\nExit.\n  King.

He will come\nstraight. Look you lay home to\nhim.\n    Tell him his pranks\nhave been too broad to bear\nwith,\n    And that your Grace\nhath screen'd and stood between\nMuch heat and him.

Go, go, you question with a\nwicked tongue.\n  Queen. Why, how\nnow, Hamlet?  \n  Ham. What's the\nmatter now?\n  Queen. Have you\nforgot me?\n  Ham. No, by the\nrood, not so!\n    You are the\nQueen, your husband's brother's\nwife,\n    And (would it were not\nso!) you are my mother.\n  Queen.\nNay, then I'll set those to you\nthat can speak.\n  Ham. Come,\ncome, and sit you down. You\nshall not budge I\n    You go not\ntill I set you up a glass\nWhere\nyou may see the inmost\npart of\nyou.\n  Queen.

What\nhave I done that thou dar'st wag\nthy tongue\n    In noise so rude\nagainst me?\n  Ham. Such an act\nThat blurs the grace and blush\nof modesty;\n    Calls virtue\nhypocrite; takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an\ninnocent love,\n    And sets a\nblister there; makes marriage\nvows\n    As false as dicers'\noaths. O, such a deed\n    As\nfrom the body of contraction\nplucks  \n    The very soul, and\nsweet religion makes\n    A\nrhapsody of words! Heaven's face\ndoth glow;\n    Yea, this\nsolidity and compound mass,\nWith\ntristful visage, as against\nthe\ndoom,\n    Is thought-sick at\nthe\nact.\n  Queen.

Ha!\nhave you eyes\nYou cannot\ncall it love; for at\nyour age\nThe heyday in the blood\nis tame,\nit's humble,\n    And\nwaits upon\nthe judgment; and\nwhat judgment\nWould step from\nthis to this?\nSense sure you\nhave,\n    Else\ncould you not\nhave motion; but\nsure that sense\nIs\napoplex'd; for madness would\nnot\nerr,\n    Nor sense to\necstacy\nwas ne'er so thrall'd\nBut it\nreserv'd some quantity of\nchoice\nTo serve in such a\ndifference.\nWhat devil was't\nThat thus\nhath cozen'd you at\nhoodman-\nblind?\n    Eyes without\nfeeling,\nfeeling without sight,\nEars\nwithout hands or eyes,\nsmelling\nsans all,\n    Or but a\nsickly\npart of one true sense\nCould\nnot so mope.\n    O shame!\nwhere\nis thy blush?

O, speak to\nme no\nmore!\n    These words like\ndaggers enter in mine ears.\nNo\nmore, sweet Hamlet!\n  Ham. A\nmurtherer and a villain!\n    A\nslave that is not twentieth part\nthe tithe\n    Of your precedent\nlord; a vice of kings;\n    A\ncutpurse of the empire and the\nrule,\n    That from a shelf the\nprecious diadem stole\n    And\nput it in his pocket!  \n  Queen.\nNo more!\n\n                Enter\nthe Ghost in his nightgown.\nHam.\nA king of shreds and\npatches!-\nSave me and hover\no'er me with\nyour wings,\n    You\nheavenly\nguards!

How\nis it with you, lady?\n  Queen.\nAlas, how is't with you,\nThat\nyou do bend your eye on\nvacancy,\nAnd with th'\nencorporal air do\nhold\ndiscourse?\n    Forth at\nyour\neyes your spirits wildly\npeep;\nAnd, as the sleeping\nsoldiers in\nth' alarm,\n    Your\nbedded\nhairs, like life in\nexcrements,\nStart up and stand\nan end. O\ngentle son,\n    Upon\nthe beat\nand flame of thy\ndistemper\nSprinkle cool\npatience! Whereon\ndo you look?\nHam. On him, on\nhim! Look you\nhow pale he\nglares!\n    His form\nand cause\nconjoin'd, preaching\nto stones,\nWould make them\ncapable.- Do not\nlook upon me,\nLest with this\npiteous action\nyou convert\nMy stern effects.\nThen what I\nhave to do\n    Will\nwant true\ncolour- tears\nperchance for\nblood.\n  Queen. To\nwhom do you\nspeak this?\n  Ham.\nDo you see\nnothing there?\nQueen. Nothing\nat all; yet all\nthat is I see.\nHam. Nor did you\nnothing hear?\nQueen. No, nothing\nbut\nourselves.\n  Ham.

How\ncan that be, unless she drown'd\nherself in her own\n    defence?\nOther. Why, 'tis found so.\nClown. It must be se offendendo;\nit cannot be else. For here lies\nthe point: if I drown myself\nwittingly, it argues an act; and\nan\n    act hath three branches-\nit is to act, to do, and to\nperform;\n    argal, she drown'd\nherself wittingly.\n  Other. Nay,\nbut hear you, Goodman Delver!\nClown. Give me leave. Here lies\nthe water; good. Here stands the\nman; good. If the man go to this\nwater and drown himself, it is,\nwill he nill he, he goes- mark\nyou that. But if the water come\nto\n    him and drown him, he\ndrowns not himself.

A pestilence on\nhim for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a\nflagon of\n    Rhenish on my head\nonce. This same skull, sir, was\nYorick's\n    skull, the King's\njester.\n  Ham.

Wilt thou know\nTh' effect of what I wrote?\nHor.\nAy, good my lord.\n  Ham. An\nearnest conjuration from the\nKing,\n    As England was his\nfaithful tributary,\n    As love\nbetween them like the palm might\nflourish,\n    As peace should\nstill her wheaten garland wear\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their\namities,\n    And many such-like\nas's of great charge,\n    That,\non the view and knowing of these\ncontents,\n    Without debatement\nfurther, more or less,\n    He\nshould the bearers put to sudden\ndeath,\n    Not shriving time\nallow'd.\n  Hor.

Your lordship is right\nwelcome back to Denmark.\n  Ham.\nI humbly thank you, sir. [Aside\nto Horatio] Dost know this\nwaterfly?\n  Hor. [aside to\nHamlet] No, my good lord.\n  Ham.\n[aside to Horatio] Thy state is\nthe more gracious; for 'tis a\nvice to know him. He hath much\nland, and fertile. Let a beast\nbe\n    lord of beasts, and his\ncrib shall stand at the king's\nmess. 'Tis\n    a chough; but, as\nI say, spacious in the\npossession of dirt.  \n  Osr.\nSweet lord, if your lordship\nwere at leisure, I should impart\na thing to you from his Majesty.\nHam. I will receive it, sir,\nwith all diligence of spirit.\nPut your\n    bonnet to his right\nuse. 'Tis for the head.\n  Osr. I\nthank your lordship, it is very\nhot.\n  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis\nvery cold; the wind is\nnortherly.\n  Osr. It is\nindifferent cold, my lord,\nindeed.\n  Ham. But yet methinks\nit is very sultry and hot for my\ncomplexion.\n  Osr. Exceedingly,\nmy lord; it is very sultry, as\n'twere- I cannot\n    tell how.\nBut, my lord, his Majesty bade\nme signify to you that\n    he\nhas laid a great wager on your\nhead. Sir, this is the matter-\nHam. I beseech you remember.\n[Hamlet moves him to put on his\nhat.]\n  Osr. Nay, good my lord;\nfor mine ease, in good faith.\nSir, here is\n    newly come to\ncourt Laertes; believe me, an\nabsolute gentleman,\n    full of\nmost excellent differences, of\nvery soft society and\n    great\nshowing. Indeed, to speak\nfeelingly of him, he is the card\nor calendar of gentry; for you\nshall find in him the continent\nof\n    what part a gentleman\nwould see.\n  Ham. Sir, his\ndefinement suffers no perdition\nin you; though, I  \n    know, to\ndivide him inventorially would\ndozy th' arithmetic of\nmemory,\nand yet but yaw neither\nin\nrespect of his quick sail.\nBut,\nin the verity of extolment,\nI\ntake him to be a soul of great\narticle, and his infusion of\nsuch dearth and rareness as, to\nmake\n    true diction of him,\nhis semblable is his mirror, and\nwho else\n    would trace him,\nhis umbrage, nothing more.\nOsr.\nYour lordship speaks most\ninfallibly of him.\n  Ham. The\nconcernancy, sir? Why do we wrap\nthe gentleman in our more\nrawer\nbreath\n  Osr. Sir?\n  Hor\n[aside\nto Hamlet] Is't not\npossible to\nunderstand in\nanother\ntongue? You will\ndo't, sir,\nreally.\n  Ham. What\nimports the\nnomination of this\ngentleman\nOsr. Of Laertes?\nHor. [aside]\nHis purse is empty\nalready.\nAll's golden words are\nspent.\nHam. Of him, sir.\nOsr. I know\nyou are not\nignorant-\n  Ham. I\nwould you\ndid, sir; yet, in\nfaith, if you\ndid, it would not\nmuch\napprove me. Well, sir?\nOsr.\nYou are not ignorant of\nwhat\nexcellence Laertes is-\nHam. I\ndare not confess that,\nlest I\nshould compare with him\nin\nexcellence; but to know a man\nwell were to know himself.\nOsr.\nI mean, sir, for his\nweapon; but\nin the imputation\nlaid on him\nby them, in his\nmeed he's\nunfellowed.\n  Ham.\nWhat's his\nweapon?\n  Osr. Rapier\nand\ndagger.\n  Ham. That's two of\nhis\nweapons- but well.\n  Osr.\nThe\nKing, sir, hath wager'd with\nhim\nsix Barbary horses;\nagainst the\nwhich he has\nimpon'd, as I take\nit, six\nFrench\n    rapiers and\nponiards,\nwith their assigns, as\ngirdle,\nhangers, and\n    so.\nThree of\nthe carriages, in\nfaith, are\nvery dear to fancy,\nvery\nresponsive to the hilts,\nmost\ndelicate carriages, and of\nvery liberal conceit.\n  Ham.\nWhat call you the carriages?\nHor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew\nyou must be edified by the\nmargent\n    ere you had done.\nOsr. The carriages, sir, are the\nhangers.\n  Ham. The phrase would\nbe more germane to the matter if\nwe could\n    carry cannon by our\nsides. I would it might be\nhangers till then.  \n    But on!\nSix Barbary horses against six\nFrench swords, their\nassigns,\nand three liberal-\nconceited\ncarriages: that's the\nFrench\nbet against the\nDanish. Why is\nthis all impon'd,\nas you call\nit?\n  Osr. The King,\nsir, hath\nlaid that, in a dozen\npasses\nbetween\n    yourself and\nhim, he\nshall not exceed you\nthree hits;\nhe hath\n    laid on\ntwelve for\nnine, and it would\ncome to\nimmediate trial\n    if\nyour\nlordship would vouchsafe\nthe\nanswer.\n  Ham. How if I\nanswer\nno?\n  Osr. I mean, my\nlord, the\nopposition of your\nperson in\ntrial.\n  Ham. Sir, I\nwill walk\nhere in the hall. If\nit please\nhis Majesty,\n    it is\nthe\nbreathing time of day with\nme.\nLet the foils be\nbrought, the\ngentleman willing,\nand the King\nhold his purpose,\nI will win for\nhim if I can; if\nnot, I will\ngain nothing but my\nshame and\nthe odd hits.\n  Osr.\nShall I\nredeliver you e'en so?\nHam. To\nthis effect, sir, after\nwhat\nflourish your nature will.\nOsr.\nI commend my duty to your\nlordship.\n  Ham. Yours, yours.\n[Exit Osric.] He does well to\ncommend it\n    himself; there\nare no tongues else for's turn.\nHor. This lapwing runs away with\nthe shell on his head.  \n  Ham.\nHe did comply with his dug\nbefore he suck'd it. Thus has\nhe,\n    and many more of the\nsame bevy that I know the drossy\nage dotes\n    on, only got the\ntune of the time and outward\nhabit of encounter-\n    a kind\nof yesty collection, which\ncarries them through and\nthrough\nthe most fann'd and\nwinnowed\nopinions; and do but\nblow\nthem to their trial-the\nbubbles\nare out,\nEnter a Lord.\n\n  Lord.\nMy lord,\nhis Majesty commended\nhim to you\nby young Osric, who\nbrings\nback to him, that you\nattend him\nin the hall. He sends\nto\nknow if your pleasure hold to\nplay with Laertes, or that you\nwill\n    take longer time.\nHam.\nI am constant to my\npurposes;\nthey follow the King's\npleasure.\nIf his fitness\nspeaks, mine is\nready; now or\nwhensoever,\nprovided\n    I be so\nable as\nnow.\n  Lord. The King\nand Queen\nand all are coming\ndown.\n  Ham.\nIn happy time.\nLord. The Queen\ndesires you to\nuse some gentle\nentertainment to\nLaertes before\nyou fall to play.\nHam. She well\ninstructs me.\n[Exit Lord.]\nHor. You will\nlose this wager,\nmy lord.\n  Ham.\nI do not think\nso. Since he went\ninto France I\nhave been in\ncontinual practice.\nI shall win\nat the odds. But\nthou wouldst\nnot\n    think how\nill all's here\nabout my heart.\nBut it is no\nmatter.\n  Hor. Nay,\ngood my lord\n-\n  Ham. It is but\nfoolery; but\nit is such a kind\nof gaingiving\nas\n    would\nperhaps trouble a\nwoman.\n  Hor.\nIf your mind\ndislike anything,\nobey it. I\nwill forestall their\nrepair\nhither and say you are\nnot fit.\nHam. Not a whit, we\ndefy augury;\nthere's a special\nprovidence in\nthe fall of a\nsparrow. If it be\nnow, 'tis not\nto come', if it be\nnot to come,\nit will be now; if\nit be not\nnow, yet it will come:\nthe\nreadiness is all. Since no\nman\nknows aught of what he\nleaves,\nwhat is't to leave\nbetimes? Let\nbe.\n\n    Enter\nKing, Queen,\nLaertes, Osric, and\nLords, with\nother\nAttendants with foils and\ngauntlets.\n               A\ntable and flagons of wine on it.\nKing. Come, Hamlet, come, and\ntake this hand from me.\n[The\nKing puts Laertes' hand\ninto\nHamlet's.]\n  Ham. Give me\nyour\npardon, sir. I have done\nyou\nwrong;\n    But pardon't, as\nyou\nare a gentleman.\n    This\npresence knows,\n    And you must\nneeds have heard, how I am\npunish'd\n    With sore\ndistraction. What I have done\nThat might your nature, honour,\nand exception\n    Roughly awake,\nI here proclaim was madness.\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?\nNever Hamlet.\n    If Hamlet from\nhimself be taken away,\n    And\nwhen he's not himself does wrong\nLaertes,\n    Then Hamlet does it\nnot, Hamlet denies it.\n    Who\ndoes it, then? His madness. If't\nbe so,\n    Hamlet is of the\nfaction that is wrong'd;\n    His\nmadness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\nSir, in this audience,\n    Let\nmy disclaiming from a purpos'd\nevil\n    Free me so far in your\nmost generous thoughts\nThat I\nhave shot my arrow o'er\nthe\nhouse\n    And hurt my\nbrother.\nLaer. I am satisfied\nin nature,\nWhose motive in\nthis case should\nstir me most\nTo my revenge. But\nin my terms\nof honour\n    I\nstand aloof, and\nwill no\nreconcilement\n    Till\nby some\nelder masters of known\nhonour\nI have a voice and\nprecedent of\npeace\n    To keep\nmy name\nungor'd. But till that\ntime\nI do receive your\noffer'd love\nlike love,\n    And\nwill not\nwrong it.\n  Ham. I\nembrace it\nfreely,\n    And will\nthis\nbrother's wager frankly\nplay.\nGive us the foils.\nCome on.\nLaer. Come, one for\nme.\n  Ham.\nI'll be your foil,\nLaertes. In\nmine ignorance\nYour skill shall,\nlike a star i'\nth' darkest\nnight,\n    Stick\nfiery off\nindeed.\n  Laer. You\nmock me,\nsir.\n  Ham. No, by this\nbad.\nKing. Give them the\nfoils, young\nOsric. Cousin\nHamlet,\n    You\nknow the wager?\nHam. Very well,\nmy lord.\nYour Grace has laid the\nodds o'\nth' weaker side.\n  King.\nI do\nnot fear it, I have seen\nyou\nboth;\n    But since he is\nbetter'd, we have therefore\nodds.\n  Laer. This is too heavy;\nlet me see another.\n  Ham. This\nlikes me well. These foils have\nall a length?\nPrepare to play.\nOsr. Ay, my\ngood lord.\n  King.\nSet me the\nstoups of wine upon\nthat table.\nIf Hamlet give the\nfirst or\nsecond hit,\n    Or quit\nin\nanswer of the third exchange,\nLet all the battlements their\nordnance fire;\n    The King\nshall drink to Hamlet's better\nbreath,\n    And in the cup an\nunion shall he throw\n    Richer\nthan that which four successive\nkings\n    In Denmark's crown\nhave worn. Give me the cups;\nAnd\nlet the kettle to the\ntrumpet\nspeak,\n    The trumpet\nto the\ncannoneer without,\nThe cannons\nto the heavens, the\nheaven to\nearth,\n    'Now the\nKing drinks\nto Hamlet.' Come,\nbegin.\n    And\nyou the judges,\nbear a wary eye.\nHam. Come on,\nsir.\n  Laer. Come,\nmy lord.\nThey play.\n  Ham. One.\nLaer.\nNo.\n  Ham. Judgment!\nOsr. A\nhit, a very palpable hit.\nLaer. Well, again!\n  King. Stay,\ngive me drink. Hamlet, this\npearl is thine;\n    Here's to\nthy health.\n[Drum; trumpets\nsound; a piece\ngoes off\n[within].\n    Give him\nthe cup.\nHam. I'll play this\nbout first;\nset it by awhile.\nCome. (They\nplay.) Another hit.\nWhat say\nyou?\n  Laer. A touch, a\ntouch; I\ndo confess't.\n  King.\nOur son\nshall win.\n  Queen. He's\nfat,\nand scant of breath.\nHere,\nHamlet, take my napkin,\nrub thy\nbrows.  \n    The Queen\ncarouses\nto thy fortune, Hamlet.\nHam.\nGood madam!\n  King.\nGertrude, do\nnot drink.\n  Queen.\nI will, my\nlord; I pray you\npardon me.\nDrinks.\nKing. [aside] It is the\npoison'd\ncup; it is too late.\nHam. I\ndare not drink yet,\nmadam; by-\nand-by.\n  Queen.\nCome, let me\nwipe thy face.\nLaer. My lord,\nI'll hit him now.\nKing. I do\nnot think't.\n  Laer.\n[aside] And\nyet it is almost\nagainst my\nconscience.\n  Ham.\nCome for the\nthird, Laertes! You\nbut dally.\npray You Pass with\nyour best\nviolence;\n    I am\nafeard You\nmake a wanton of me.\nLaer. Say\nyou so? Come on.\nPlay.\nOsr. Nothing neither\nway.\nLaer. Have at you now!\n[Laertes\nwounds Hamlet; then] in\nscuffling, they\nchange rapiers,\n[and Hamlet\nwounds Laertes].\nKing. Part\nthem! They are\nincens'd.\n  Ham.\nNay come!\nagain!\nThe Queen falls.  \n  Osr.\nLook\nto the Queen there, ho!\nHor.\nThey bleed on both sides.\nHow is\nit, my lord?\n  Osr. How\nis't,\nLaertes?\n  Laer. Why, as a\nwoodcock to mine own springe,\nOsric.\n    I am justly kill'd\nwith mine own treachery.\n  Ham.\nHow does the Queen?\n  King. She\nsounds to see them bleed.\nQueen.\nNo, no! the drink, the\ndrink! O\nmy dear Hamlet!\n    The\ndrink,\nthe drink! I am poison'd.\n[Dies.]\n  Ham. O villany! Ho!\nlet the door be lock'd.\nTreachery! Seek it out.\n[Laertes\nfalls.]\n  Laer. It is\nhere,\nHamlet. Hamlet, thou art\nslain;\nNo medicine in the\nworld can do\nthee good.\n    In\nthee there is\nnot half an hour\nof life.\nThe treacherous\ninstrument is in\nthy hand,\nUnbated and envenom'd.\nThe foul\npractice\n    Hath\nturn'd itself\non me. Lo, here I\nlie,\n    Never\nto rise again.\nThy mother's\npoison'd.\n    I can\nno more. The\nKing, the King's to\nblame.\nHam. The point envenom'd\ntoo?\nThen, venom, to thy work.\nHurts the King.\n  All. Treason!\ntreason!\n  King. O, yet defend\nme, friends! I am but hurt.\nHam.\nHere, thou incestuous,\nmurd'rous, damned Dane,\nDrink\noff this potion! Is thy\nunion\nhere?\n    Follow my\nmother.\nKing\ndies.\n  Laer. He is justly\nserv'd.\n    It is a poison\ntemper'd by himself.\nExchange\nforgiveness with me,\nnoble\nHamlet.\n    Mine and my\nfather's\ndeath come not upon\nthee,\nNor thine on me!\nDies.\n  Ham.\nHeaven make thee\nfree of it! I\nfollow thee.\n    I\nam dead,\nHoratio. Wretched\nqueen, adieu!\nYou that look\npale and tremble\nat this chance,\nThat are but\nmutes or audience\nto this act,\nHad I but time\n(as this fell\nsergeant, Death,\nIs strict in\nhis arrest) O, I\ncould tell you-\nBut let it\nbe. Horatio, I am\ndead;\n    Thou\nliv'st; report me\nand my cause\naright  \n    To the\nunsatisfied.\nHor. Never believe\nit.\n    I am\nmore an antique\nRoman than a\nDane.\n    Here's\nyet some liquor\nleft.\n  Ham. As\nth'art a man,\nGive me the cup.\nLet go! By\nheaven, I'll ha't.\nO good\nHoratio, what a wounded\nname\n(Things standing thus\nunknown)\nshall live behind me!\nIf\nthou didst ever hold me in\nthy\nheart,\n    Absent thee from\nfelicity awhile,\n    And in this\nharsh world draw thy breath in\npain,\n    To tell my story.\n[March afar off, and shot\nwithin.]\n    What warlike noise\nis this?\n  Osr. Young\nFortinbras, with conquest come\nfrom Poland,\n    To the\nambassadors of England gives\nThis warlike volley.\n  Ham. O, I\ndie, Horatio!\n    The potent\npoison quite o'ercrows my\nspirit.\n    I cannot live to\nhear the news from England,\nBut\nI do prophesy th' election\nlights  \n    On Fortinbras. He\nhas my dying voice.\n    So tell\nhim, with th' occurrents, more\nand less,\n    Which have\nsolicited- the rest is silence.\nDies.\n  Hor. Now cracks a noble\nheart. Good night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee\nto thy rest!\n[March within.]\nWhy does the\ndrum come hither?\nEnter\nFortinbras and English\nAmbassadors, with Drum,\nColours,\nand Attendants.\nFort. Where is\nthis sight?\nHor. What is it you\nwill see?\nIf aught of woe or\nwonder, cease\nyour search.\nFort. This quarry\ncries on\nhavoc. O proud Death,\nWhat feast\nis toward in thine\neternal cell\nThat thou so\nmany princes at a\nshot\n    So\nbloodily hast\nstruck.\nAmbassador. The sight is\ndismal;\nAnd our affairs from\nEngland\ncome too late.  \n    The\nears\nare senseless that should\ngive\nus bearing\n    To tell him\nhis\ncommandment is fulfill'd\nThat Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern are dead.\n    Where\nshould We have our thanks?\nHor.\nNot from his mouth,\n    Had\nit\nth' ability of life to thank\nyou.\n    He never gave\ncommandment for their death.\nBut\nsince, so jump upon this\nbloody\nquestion,\n    You from\nthe\nPolack wars, and you from\nEngland,\n    Are here arriv'd,\ngive order that these bodies\nHigh on a stage be placed to the\nview;\n    And let me speak to\nthe yet unknowing world\n    How\nthese things came about. So\nshall You hear\n    Of carnal,\nbloody and unnatural acts;\nOf\naccidental judgments, casual\nslaughters;\n    Of deaths put on\nby cunning and forc'd cause;\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes\nmistook\n    Fall'n on th'\ninventors' heads. All this can I\nTruly deliver.\n  Fort. Let us\nhaste to hear it,  \n    And call\nthe noblest to the audience.\nFor\nme, with sorrow I embrace my\nfortune.\n    I have some rights\nof memory in this kingdom\nWhich\nnow, to claim my vantage\ndoth\ninvite me.\n  Hor. Of that I\nshall have also cause to speak,\nAnd from his mouth whose voice\nwill draw on more.\n    But let\nthis same be presently\nperform'd,\n    Even while men's\nminds are wild, lest more\nmischance\n    On plots and\nerrors happen.\n  Fort. Let four\ncaptains\n    Bear Hamlet like a\nsoldier to the stage;\n    For he\nwas likely, had he been put on,\nTo have prov'd most royally; and\nfor his passage\n    The\nsoldiers' music and the rites of\nwar\n    Speak loudly for him.\nTake up the bodies. Such a sight\nas this\n    Becomes the field\nbut here shows much amiss.\nGo,\nbid the soldiers shoot.\nExeunt\nmarching; after the which\na peal\nof ordnance\nare shot off.\nTHE END";
