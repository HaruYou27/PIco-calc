Who's\nthere.?\n  Fran. Nay, answer me.\nStand and unfold yourself.\nBer. Long live the King!\n  Fran.\nBernardo?\n  Ber. He.\n  Fran. You\ncome most carefully upon your\nhour.\n  Ber. 'Tis now struck\ntwelve. Get thee to bed,\nFrancisco.\n  Fran. For this\nrelief much thanks. 'Tis bitter\ncold,\n    And I am sick at\nheart.\n  Ber. Have you had quiet\nguard?\n  Fran. Not a mouse\nstirring.\n  Ber. Well, good\nnight.\n    If you do meet\nHoratio and Marcellus,\n    The\nrivals of my watch, bid them\nmake haste.\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\nFran. I think I hear them.\nStand, ho! Who is there?\n  Hor.\nFriends to this ground.\n  Mar.\nAnd liegemen to the Dane.\nFran. Give you good night.\nMar. O, farewell, honest\nsoldier.\n    Who hath reliev'd\nyou?\n  Fran. Bernardo hath my\nplace.\n    Give you good night.\nExit.\n  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!\nBer. Say-\n    What, is Horatio\nthere ?\n  Hor. A piece of him.\nBer. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome,\ngood Marcellus.\n  Mar. What, has\nthis thing appear'd again to-\nnight?\n  Ber. I have seen\nnothing.\n  Mar. Horatio says\n'tis but our fantasy,\n    And\nwill not let belief take hold of\nhim\n    Touching this dreaded\nsight, twice seen of us.\nTherefore I have entreated him\nalong,  \n    With us to watch\nthe minutes of this night,\nThat, if again this apparition\ncome,\n    He may approve our\neyes and speak to it.\n  Hor.\nTush, tush, 'twill not appear.\nBer. Sit down awhile,\n    And\nlet us once again assail your\nears,\n    That are so fortified\nagainst our story,\n    What we\ntwo nights have seen.\n  Hor.\nWell, sit we down,\n    And let\nus hear Bernardo speak of this.\nBer. Last night of all,\n    When\nyond same star that's westward\nfrom the pole\n    Had made his\ncourse t' illume that part of\nheaven\n    Where now it burns,\nMarcellus and myself,\n    The\nbell then beating one-\nEnter Ghost.\n\n  Mar. Peace!\nbreak thee off! Look where it\ncomes again!\n  Ber. In the same\nfigure, like the King that's\ndead.  \n  Mar. Thou art a\nscholar; speak to it, Horatio.\nBer. Looks it not like the King?\nMark it, Horatio.\n  Hor. Most\nlike. It harrows me with fear\nand wonder.\n  Ber. It would be\nspoke to.\n  Mar. Question it,\nHoratio.\n  Hor. What art thou\nthat usurp'st this time of night\nTogether with that fair and\nwarlike form\n    In which the\nmajesty of buried Denmark\nDid sometimes march? By heaven I\ncharge thee speak!\n  Mar. It is\noffended.\n  Ber. See, it stalks\naway!\n  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak!\nI charge thee speak!\nExit Ghost.\n  Mar. 'Tis gone and\nwill not answer.\n  Ber. How now,\nHoratio? You tremble and look\npale.\n    Is not this something\nmore than fantasy?\n    What\nthink you on't?\n  Hor. Before my\nGod, I might not this believe\nWithout the sensible and true\navouch\n    Of mine own eyes.\nMar. Is it not like the King?\nHor. As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armour he had\non\n    When he th' ambitious\nNorway combated.\n    So frown'd\nhe once when, in an angry parle,\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on\nthe ice.\n    'Tis strange.\nMar. Thus twice before, and jump\nat this dead hour,\n    With\nmartial stalk hath he gone by\nour watch.\n  Hor. In what\nparticular thought to work I\nknow not;\n    But, in the gross\nand scope of my opinion,\nThis bodes some strange eruption\nto our state.\n  Mar. Good now,\nsit down, and tell me he that\nknows,\n    Why this same strict\nand most observant watch\n    So\nnightly toils the subject of the\nland,\n    And why such daily\ncast of brazen cannon\n    And\nforeign mart for implements of\nwar;\n    Why such impress of\nshipwrights, whose sore task\nDoes not divide the Sunday from\nthe week.\n    What might be\ntoward, that this sweaty haste\nDoth make the night joint-\nlabourer with the day?\n    Who\nis't that can inform me?\n  Hor.\nThat can I.\n    At least, the\nwhisper goes so. Our last king,\nWhose image even but now\nappear'd to us,\n    Was, as you\nknow, by Fortinbras of Norway,\nThereto prick'd on by a most\nemulate pride,\n    Dar'd to the\ncombat; in which our valiant\nHamlet\n    (For so this side of\nour known world esteem'd him)\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who,\nby a seal'd compact,\n    Well\nratified by law and heraldry,\nDid forfeit, with his life, all\nthose his lands\n    Which he\nstood seiz'd of, to the\nconqueror;\n    Against the which\na moiety competent\n    Was gaged\nby our king; which had return'd\nTo the inheritance of\nFortinbras,\n    Had he been\nvanquisher, as, by the same\ncomart\n    And carriage of the\narticle design'd,\n    His fell\nto Hamlet. Now, sir, young\nFortinbras,\n    Of unimproved\nmettle hot and full,  \n    Hath\nin the skirts of Norway, here\nand there,\n    Shark'd up a list\nof lawless resolutes,\n    For\nfood and diet, to some\nenterprise\n    That hath a\nstomach in't; which is no other,\nAs it doth well appear unto our\nstate,\n    But to recover of us,\nby strong hand\n    And terms\ncompulsatory, those foresaid\nlands\n    So by his father lost;\nand this, I take it,\n    Is the\nmain motive of our preparations,\nThe source of this our watch,\nand the chief head\n    Of this\npost-haste and romage in the\nland.\n  Ber. I think it be no\nother but e'en so.\n    Well may\nit sort that this portentous\nfigure\n    Comes armed through\nour watch, so like the King\nThat was and is the question of\nthese wars.\n  Hor. A mote it is\nto trouble the mind's eye.\nIn the most high and palmy state\nof Rome,\n    A little ere the\nmightiest Julius fell,\n    The\ngraves stood tenantless, and the\nsheeted dead\n    Did squeak and\ngibber in the Roman streets;\nAs stars with trains of fire,\nand dews of blood,\n    Disasters\nin the sun; and the moist star\nUpon whose influence Neptune's\nempire stands\n    Was sick\nalmost to doomsday with eclipse.\nAnd even the like precurse of\nfierce events,\n    As harbingers\npreceding still the fates\nAnd prologue to the omen coming\non,\n    Have heaven and earth\ntogether demonstrated\n    Unto\nour climature and countrymen.\nEnter Ghost again.\n\n    But\nsoft! behold! Lo, where it comes\nagain!\n    I'll cross it, though\nit blast me.- Stay illusion!\nSpreads his arms.\n    If thou\nhast any sound, or use of voice,\nSpeak to me.\n    If there be any\ngood thing to be done,\n    That\nmay to thee do ease, and, race\nto me,\n    Speak to me.  \n    If\nthou art privy to thy country's\nfate,\n    Which happily\nforeknowing may avoid,\n    O,\nspeak!\n    Or if thou hast\nuphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of\nearth\n    (For which, they say,\nyou spirits oft walk in death),\nThe cock crows.\n    Speak of it!\nStay, and speak!- Stop it,\nMarcellus!\n  Mar. Shall I strike\nat it with my partisan?\n  Hor.\nDo, if it will not stand.\n  Ber.\n'Tis here!\n  Hor. 'Tis here!\nMar. 'Tis gone!\nExit Ghost.\n    We do it wrong,\nbeing so majestical,\n    To\noffer it the show of violence;\nFor it is as the air,\ninvulnerable,\n    And our vain\nblows malicious mockery.\n  Ber.\nIt was about to speak, when the\ncock crew.\n  Hor. And then it\nstarted, like a guilty thing\nUpon a fearful summons. I have\nheard\n    The cock, that is the\ntrumpet to the morn,\n    Doth\nwith his lofty and shrill-\nsounding throat\n    Awake the\ngod of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth\nor air,\n    Th' extravagant and\nerring spirit hies\n    To his\nconfine; and of the truth herein\nThis present object made\nprobation.\n  Mar. It faded on\nthe crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever, 'gainst that\nseason comes\n    Wherein our\nSaviour's birth is celebrated,\nThe bird of dawning singeth all\nnight long;\n    And then, they\nsay, no spirit dare stir abroad,\nThe nights are wholesome, then\nno planets strike,\n    No fairy\ntakes, nor witch hath power to\ncharm,\n    So hallow'd and so\ngracious is the time.\n  Hor. So\nhave I heard and do in part\nbelieve it.\n    But look, the\nmorn, in russet mantle clad,\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high\neastward hill.\n    Break we our\nwatch up; and by my advice\nLet us impart what we have seen\nto-night\n    Unto young Hamlet;\nfor, upon my life,\n    This\nspirit, dumb to us, will speak\nto him.\n    Do you consent we\nshall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting\nour duty?\n    Let's do't, I\npray; and I this morning know\nWhere we shall find him most\nconveniently.           Exeunt.\nScene II.\nElsinore. A room of\nstate in the Castle.\n\nFlourish.\n[Enter Claudius, King of\nDenmark, Gertrude the Queen,\nHamlet,\nPolonius, Laertes and\nhis sister Ophelia, [Voltemand,\nCornelius,]\nLords Attendant.\nKing. Though yet of Hamlet our\ndear brother's death\n    The\nmemory be green, and that it us\nbefitted\n    To bear our hearts\nin grief, and our whole kingdom\nTo be contracted in one brow of\nwoe,\n    Yet so far hath\ndiscretion fought with nature\nThat we with wisest sorrow think\non him\n    Together with\nremembrance of ourselves.\nTherefore our sometime sister,\nnow our queen,\n    Th' imperial\njointress to this warlike state,\nHave we, as 'twere with a\ndefeated joy,\n    With an\nauspicious, and a dropping eye,\nWith mirth in funeral, and with\ndirge in marriage,\n    In equal\nscale weighing delight and dole,\nTaken to wife; nor have we\nherein barr'd\n    Your better\nwisdoms, which have freely gone\nWith this affair along. For all,\nour thanks.\n    Now follows,\nthat you know, young Fortinbras,\nHolding a weak supposal of our\nworth,\n    Or thinking by our\nlate dear brother's death\nOur state to be disjoint and out\nof frame,\n    Colleagued with\nthis dream of his advantage,\nHe hath not fail'd to pester us\nwith message\n    Importing the\nsurrender of those lands\nLost by his father, with all\nbands of law,\n    To our most\nvaliant brother. So much for\nhim.\n    Now for ourself and for\nthis time of meeting.\n    Thus\nmuch the business is: we have\nhere writ\n    To Norway, uncle\nof young Fortinbras,\n    Who,\nimpotent and bedrid, scarcely\nhears\n    Of this his nephew's\npurpose, to suppress\n    His\nfurther gait herein, in that the\nlevies,\n    The lists, and full\nproportions are all made\n    Out\nof his subject; and we here\ndispatch\n    You, good\nCornelius, and you, Voltemand,\nFor bearers of this greeting to\nold Norway,  \n    Giving to you\nno further personal power\n    To\nbusiness with the King, more\nthan the scope\n    Of these\ndilated articles allow.\n[Gives a paper.]\n    Farewell,\nand let your haste commend your\nduty.\n  Cor., Volt. In that, and\nall things, will we show our\nduty.\n  King. We doubt it\nnothing. Heartily farewell.\nExeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.\nAnd now, Laertes, what's the\nnews with you?\n    You told us\nof some suit. What is't,\nLaertes?\n    You cannot speak of\nreason to the Dane\n    And lose\nyour voice. What wouldst thou\nbeg, Laertes,\n    That shall not\nbe my offer, not thy asking?\nThe head is not more native to\nthe heart,\n    The hand more\ninstrumental to the mouth,\nThan is the throne of Denmark to\nthy father.\n    What wouldst\nthou have, Laertes?\n  Laer. My\ndread lord,\n    Your leave and\nfavour to return to France;\nFrom whence though willingly I\ncame to Denmark\n    To show my\nduty in your coronation,\nYet now I must confess, that\nduty done,\n    My thoughts and\nwishes bend again toward France\nAnd bow them to your gracious\nleave and pardon.\n  King. Have\nyou your father's leave? What\nsays Polonius?\n  Pol. He hath,\nmy lord, wrung from me my slow\nleave\n    By laboursome\npetition, and at last\n    Upon\nhis will I seal'd my hard\nconsent.\n    I do beseech you\ngive him leave to go.\n  King.\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes.\nTime be thine,\n    And thy best\ngraces spend it at thy will!\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and\nmy son-\n  Ham. [aside] A little\nmore than kin, and less than\nkind!\n  King. How is it that the\nclouds still hang on you?\n  Ham.\nNot so, my lord. I am too much\ni' th' sun.\n  Queen. Good\nHamlet, cast thy nighted colour\noff,\n    And let thine eye look\nlike a friend on Denmark.\n    Do\nnot for ever with thy vailed\nlids\n    Seek for thy noble\nfather in the dust.\n    Thou\nknow'st 'tis common. All that\nlives must die,\n    Passing\nthrough nature to eternity.\nHam. Ay, madam, it is common.\nQueen. If it be,\n    Why seems\nit so particular with thee?\nHam. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I\nknow not 'seems.'\n    'Tis not\nalone my inky cloak, good\nmother,\n    Nor customary suits\nof solemn black,\n    Nor windy\nsuspiration of forc'd breath,\nNo, nor the fruitful river in\nthe eye,\n    Nor the dejected\nhavior of the visage,\nTogether with all forms, moods,\nshapes of grief,\n    'That can\ndenote me truly. These indeed\nseem,\n    For they are actions\nthat a man might play;\n    But I\nhave that within which passeth\nshow-\n    These but the\ntrappings and the suits of woe.\nKing. 'Tis sweet and commendable\nin your nature, Hamlet,\n    To\ngive these mourning duties to\nyour father;\n    But you must\nknow, your father lost a father;\nThat father lost, lost his, and\nthe survivor bound\n    In filial\nobligation for some term\n    To\ndo obsequious sorrow. But to\npersever  \n    In obstinate\ncondolement is a course\n    Of\nimpious stubbornness. 'Tis\nunmanly grief;\n    It shows a\nwill most incorrect to heaven,\nA heart unfortified, a mind\nimpatient,\n    An understanding\nsimple and unschool'd;\n    For\nwhat we know must be, and is as\ncommon\n    As any the most\nvulgar thing to sense,\n    Why\nshould we in our peevish\nopposition\n    Take it to heart?\nFie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\nA fault against the dead, a\nfault to nature,\n    To reason\nmost absurd, whose common theme\nIs death of fathers, and who\nstill hath cried,\n    From the\nfirst corse till he that died\nto-day,\n    'This must be so.'\nWe pray you throw to earth\nThis unprevailing woe, and think\nof us\n    As of a father; for\nlet the world take note\n    You\nare the most immediate to our\nthrone,\n    And with no less\nnobility of love\n    Than that\nwhich dearest father bears his\nson\n    Do I impart toward you.\nFor your intent  \n    In going\nback to school in Wittenberg,\nIt is most retrograde to our\ndesire;\n    And we beseech you,\nbend you to remain\n    Here in\nthe cheer and comfort of our\neye,\n    Our chiefest courtier,\ncousin, and our son.\n  Queen.\nLet not thy mother lose her\nprayers, Hamlet.\n    I pray thee\nstay with us, go not to\nWittenberg.\n  Ham. I shall in\nall my best obey you, madam.\nKing. Why, 'tis a loving and a\nfair reply.\n    Be as ourself in\nDenmark. Madam, come.\n    This\ngentle and unforc'd accord of\nHamlet\n    Sits smiling to my\nheart; in grace whereof,\n    No\njocund health that Denmark\ndrinks to-day\n    But the great\ncannon to the clouds shall tell,\nAnd the King's rouse the heaven\nshall bruit again,\nRespeaking earthly thunder. Come\naway.\nFlourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.\nHam. O that this too too solid\nflesh would melt,\n    Thaw, and\nresolve itself into a dew!\nOr that the Everlasting had not\nfix'd  \n    His canon 'gainst\nself-slaughter! O God! God!\nHow weary, stale, flat, and\nunprofitable\n    Seem to me all\nthe uses of this world!\n    Fie\non't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded\ngarden\n    That grows to seed;\nthings rank and gross in nature\nPossess it merely. That it\nshould come to this!\n    But two\nmonths dead! Nay, not so much,\nnot two.\n    So excellent a\nking, that was to this\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving\nto my mother\n    That he might\nnot beteem the winds of heaven\nVisit her face too roughly.\nHeaven and earth!\n    Must I\nremember? Why, she would hang on\nhim\n    As if increase of\nappetite had grown\n    By what\nit fed on; and yet, within a\nmonth-\n    Let me not think\non't! Frailty, thy name is\nwoman!-\n    A little month, or\nere those shoes were old\nWith which she followed my poor\nfather's body\n    Like Niobe,\nall tears- why she, even she\n(O God! a beast that wants\ndiscourse of reason\n    Would\nhave mourn'd longer) married\nwith my uncle;  \n    My father's\nbrother, but no more like my\nfather\n    Than I to Hercules.\nWithin a month,\n    Ere yet the\nsalt of most unrighteous tears\nHad left the flushing in her\ngalled eyes,\n    She married. O,\nmost wicked speed, to post\nWith such dexterity to\nincestuous sheets!\n    It is\nnot, nor it cannot come to good.\nBut break my heart, for I must\nhold my tongue!\n\n          Enter\nHoratio, Marcellus, and\nBernardo.\n\n  Hor. Hail to your\nlordship!\n  Ham. I am glad to\nsee you well.\n    Horatio!- or I\ndo forget myself.\n  Hor. The\nsame, my lord, and your poor\nservant ever.\n  Ham. Sir, my\ngood friend- I'll change that\nname with you.\n    And what make\nyou from Wittenberg, Horatio?\nMarcellus?\n  Mar. My good lord!\nHam. I am very glad to see you.-\n[To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-\nBut what, in faith, make you\nfrom Wittenberg?\n  Hor. A truant\ndisposition, good my lord.\nHam. I would not hear your enemy\nsay so,\n    Nor shall you do my\near that violence\n    To make it\ntruster of your own report\nAgainst yourself. I know you are\nno truant.\n    But what is your\naffair in Elsinore?\n    We'll\nteach you to drink deep ere you\ndepart.\n  Hor. My lord, I came\nto see your father's funeral.\nHam. I prithee do not mock me,\nfellow student.\n    I think it\nwas to see my mother's wedding.\nHor. Indeed, my lord, it\nfollowed hard upon.\n  Ham.\nThrift, thrift, Horatio! The\nfuneral bak'd meats\n    Did\ncoldly furnish forth the\nmarriage tables.\n    Would I had\nmet my dearest foe in heaven\nOr ever I had seen that day,\nHoratio!\n    My father- methinks\nI see my father.\n  Hor. O,\nwhere, my lord?\n  Ham. In my\nmind's eye, Horatio.\n  Hor. I\nsaw him once. He was a goodly\nking.  \n  Ham. He was a man,\ntake him for all in all.\n    I\nshall not look upon his like\nagain.\n  Hor. My lord, I think I\nsaw him yesternight.\n  Ham. Saw?\nwho?\n  Hor. My lord, the King\nyour father.\n  Ham. The King my\nfather?\n  Hor. Season your\nadmiration for a while\n    With\nan attent ear, till I may\ndeliver\n    Upon the witness of\nthese gentlemen,\n    This marvel\nto you.\n  Ham. For God's love\nlet me hear!\n  Hor. Two nights\ntogether had these gentlemen\n(Marcellus and Bernardo) on\ntheir watch\n    In the dead vast\nand middle of the night\n    Been\nthus encount'red. A figure like\nyour father,\n    Armed at point\nexactly, cap-a-pe,\n    Appears\nbefore them and with solemn\nmarch\n    Goes slow and stately\nby them. Thrice he walk'd\n    By\ntheir oppress'd and fear-\nsurprised eyes,\n    Within his\ntruncheon's length; whilst they\ndistill'd  \n    Almost to jelly\nwith the act of fear,\n    Stand\ndumb and speak not to him. This\nto me\n    In dreadful secrecy\nimpart they did,\n    And I with\nthem the third night kept the\nwatch;\n    Where, as they had\ndeliver'd, both in time,\nForm of the thing, each word\nmade true and good,\n    The\napparition comes. I knew your\nfather.\n    These hands are not\nmore like.\n  Ham. But where was\nthis?\n  Mar. My lord, upon the\nplatform where we watch'd.\nHam. Did you not speak to it?\nHor. My lord, I did;\n    But\nanswer made it none. Yet once\nmethought\n    It lifted up it\nhead and did address\n    Itself\nto motion, like as it would\nspeak;\n    But even then the\nmorning cock crew loud,\n    And\nat the sound it shrunk in haste\naway\n    And vanish'd from our\nsight.\n  Ham. 'Tis very strange.\nHor. As I do live, my honour'd\nlord, 'tis true;  \n    And we\ndid think it writ down in our\nduty\n    To let you know of it.\nHam. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But\nthis troubles me.\n    Hold you\nthe watch to-night?\n  Both [Mar.\nand Ber.] We do, my lord.\n  Ham.\nArm'd, say you?\n  Both. Arm'd,\nmy lord.\n  Ham. From top to toe?\nBoth. My lord, from head to\nfoot.\n  Ham. Then saw you not\nhis face?\n  Hor. O, yes, my\nlord! He wore his beaver up.\nHam. What, look'd he frowningly.\nHor. A countenance more in\nsorrow than in anger.\n  Ham.\nPale or red?\n  Hor. Nay, very\npale.\n  Ham. And fix'd his eyes\nupon you?\n  Hor. Most\nconstantly.\n  Ham. I would I had\nbeen there.\n  Hor. It would have\nmuch amaz'd you.\n  Ham. Very\nlike, very like. Stay'd it long?\nHor. While one with moderate\nhaste might tell a hundred.\nBoth. Longer, longer.\n  Hor. Not\nwhen I saw't.\n  Ham. His beard\nwas grizzled- no?\n  Hor. It was,\nas I have seen it in his life,\nA sable silver'd.\n  Ham. I will\nwatch to-night.\n    Perchance\n'twill walk again.\n  Hor. I\nwarr'nt it will.\n  Ham. If it\nassume my noble father's person,\nI'll speak to it, though hell\nitself should gape\n    And bid\nme hold my peace. I pray you\nall,\n    If you have hitherto\nconceal'd this sight,\n    Let it\nbe tenable in your silence\nstill;\n    And whatsoever else\nshall hap to-night,\n    Give it\nan understanding but no tongue.\nI will requite your loves. So,\nfare you well.\n    Upon the\nplatform, 'twixt eleven and\ntwelve,\n    I'll visit you.\nAll. Our duty to your honour.\nHam. Your loves, as mine to you.\nFarewell.\nExeunt [all but Hamlet].\n    My\nfather's spirit- in arms? All is\nnot well.\n    I doubt some foul\nplay. Would the night were come!\nTill then sit still, my soul.\nFoul deeds will rise,\n    Though\nall the earth o'erwhelm them, to\nmen's eyes.\nExit.\n\n\n\n\nScene III.\nElsinore. A room in the house of\nPolonius.\n\nEnter Laertes and\nOphelia.\n\n  Laer. My necessaries\nare embark'd. Farewell.\n    And,\nsister, as the winds give\nbenefit\n    And convoy is\nassistant, do not sleep,\n    But\nlet me hear from you.\n  Oph. Do\nyou doubt that?\n  Laer. For\nHamlet, and the trifling of his\nfavour,\n    Hold it a fashion,\nand a toy in blood;\n    A violet\nin the youth of primy nature,\nForward, not permanent- sweet,\nnot lasting;\n    The perfume and\nsuppliance of a minute;\n    No\nmore.\n  Oph. No more but so?\nLaer. Think it no more.\n    For\nnature crescent does not grow\nalone\n    In thews and bulk; but\nas this temple waxes,\n    The\ninward service of the mind and\nsoul\n    Grows wide withal.\nPerhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth\nbesmirch\n    The virtue of his\nwill; but you must fear,\n    His\ngreatness weigh'd, his will is\nnot his own;\n    For he himself\nis subject to his birth.\n    He\nmay not, as unvalued persons do,\nCarve for himself, for on his\nchoice depends\n    The safety\nand health of this whole state,\nAnd therefore must his choice be\ncircumscrib'd\n    Unto the voice\nand yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if\nhe says he loves you,\n    It\nfits your wisdom so far to\nbelieve it\n    As he in his\nparticular act and place\n    May\ngive his saying deed; which is\nno further\n    Than the main\nvoice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour\nmay sustain\n    If with too\ncredent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your\nchaste treasure open\n    To his\nunmast'red importunity.\n    Fear\nit, Ophelia, fear it, my dear\nsister,\n    And keep you in the\nrear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of\ndesire.\n    The chariest maid is\nprodigal enough\n    If she\nunmask her beauty to the moon.\nVirtue itself scopes not\ncalumnious strokes.\n    The\ncanker galls the infants of the\nspring\n    Too oft before their\nbuttons be disclos'd,\n    And in\nthe morn and liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most\nimminent.\n    Be wary then; best\nsafety lies in fear.\n    Youth\nto itself rebels, though none\nelse near.\n  Oph. I shall th'\neffect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart. But,\ngood my brother,\n    Do not as\nsome ungracious pastors do,\nShow me the steep and thorny way\nto heaven,\n    Whiles, like a\npuff'd and reckless libertine,\nHimself the primrose path of\ndalliance treads\n    And recks\nnot his own rede.\n  Laer. O,\nfear me not!\nEnter Polonius.  \n\n    I stay\ntoo long. But here my father\ncomes.\n    A double blessing is\na double grace;\n    Occasion\nsmiles upon a second leave.\nPol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard,\naboard, for shame!\n    The wind\nsits in the shoulder of your\nsail,\n    And you are stay'd\nfor. There- my blessing with\nthee!\n    And these few precepts\nin thy memory\n    Look thou\ncharacter. Give thy thoughts no\ntongue,\n    Nor any\nunproportion'd thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no\nmeans vulgar:\n    Those friends\nthou hast, and their adoption\ntried,\n    Grapple them unto thy\nsoul with hoops of steel;\nBut do not dull thy palm with\nentertainment\n    Of each new-\nhatch'd, unfledg'd comrade.\nBeware\n    Of entrance to a\nquarrel; but being in,\nBear't that th' opposed may\nbeware of thee.\n    Give every\nman thine ear, but few thy\nvoice;\n    Take each man's\ncensure, but reserve thy\njudgment.\n    Costly thy habit\nas thy purse can buy,  \n    But\nnot express'd in fancy; rich,\nnot gaudy;\n    For the apparel\noft proclaims the man,\n    And\nthey in France of the best rank\nand station\n    Are most select\nand generous, chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender\nbe;\n    For loan oft loses both\nitself and friend,\n    And\nborrowing dulls the edge of\nhusbandry.\n    This above all-\nto thine own self be true,\nAnd it must follow, as the night\nthe day,\n    Thou canst not then\nbe false to any man.\nFarewell. My blessing season\nthis in thee!\n  Laer. Most\nhumbly do I take my leave, my\nlord.\n  Pol. The time invites\nyou. Go, your servants tend.\nLaer. Farewell, Ophelia, and\nremember well\n    What I have\nsaid to you.\n  Oph. 'Tis in my\nmemory lock'd,\n    And you\nyourself shall keep the key of\nit.\n  Laer. Farewell.\nExit.\n  Pol. What is't, Ophelia,\nhe hath said to you?\n  Oph. So\nplease you, something touching\nthe Lord Hamlet.  \n  Pol. Marry,\nwell bethought!\n    'Tis told me\nhe hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you, and\nyou yourself\n    Have of your\naudience been most free and\nbounteous.\n    If it be so- as\nso 'tis put on me,\n    And that\nin way of caution- I must tell\nyou\n    You do not understand\nyourself so clearly\n    As it\nbehooves my daughter and your\nhonour.\n    What is between you?\nGive me up the truth.\n  Oph. He\nhath, my lord, of late made many\ntenders\n    Of his affection to\nme.\n  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You\nspeak like a green girl,\nUnsifted in such perilous\ncircumstance.\n    Do you believe\nhis tenders, as you call them?\nOph. I do not know, my lord,\nwhat I should think,\n  Pol.\nMarry, I will teach you! Think\nyourself a baby\n    That you\nhave ta'en these tenders for\ntrue pay,\n    Which are not\nsterling. Tender yourself more\ndearly,\n    Or (not to crack the\nwind of the poor phrase,\nRunning it thus) you'll tender\nme a fool.  \n  Oph. My lord, he\nhath importun'd me with love\nIn honourable fashion.\n  Pol.\nAy, fashion you may call it. Go\nto, go to!\n  Oph. And hath given\ncountenance to his speech, my\nlord,\n    With almost all the\nholy vows of heaven.\n  Pol. Ay,\nspringes to catch woodcocks! I\ndo know,\n    When the blood\nburns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows. These\nblazes, daughter,\n    Giving\nmore light than heat, extinct in\nboth\n    Even in their promise,\nas it is a-making,\n    You must\nnot take for fire. From this\ntime\n    Be something scanter of\nyour maiden presence.\n    Set\nyour entreatments at a higher\nrate\n    Than a command to\nparley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him, that he\nis young,\n    And with a larger\ntether may he walk\n    Than may\nbe given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for\nthey are brokers,\n    Not of\nthat dye which their investments\nshow,\n    But mere implorators\nof unholy suits,  \n    Breathing\nlike sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is\nfor all:\n    I would not, in\nplain terms, from this time\nforth\n    Have you so slander\nany moment leisure\n    As to\ngive words or talk with the Lord\nHamlet.\n    Look to't, I charge\nyou. Come your ways.\n  Oph. I\nshall obey, my lord.\nExeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene IV.\nElsinore.\nThe platform before the Castle.\nEnter Hamlet, Horatio, and\nMarcellus.\n\n  Ham. The air bites\nshrewdly; it is very cold.\nHor. It is a nipping and an\neager air.\n  Ham. What hour now?\nHor. I think it lacks of twelve.\nMar. No, it is struck.\n  Hor.\nIndeed? I heard it not. It then\ndraws near the season\nWherein the spirit held his wont\nto walk.\n                   A\nflourish of trumpets, and two\npieces go off.\n    What does\nthis mean, my lord?\n  Ham. The\nKing doth wake to-night and\ntakes his rouse,\n    Keeps\nwassail, and the swagg'ring\nupspring reels,\n    And, as he\ndrains his draughts of Rhenish\ndown,\n    The kettledrum and\ntrumpet thus bray out\n    The\ntriumph of his pledge.\n  Hor. Is\nit a custom?\n  Ham. Ay, marry,\nis't;\n    But to my mind, though\nI am native here  \n    And to\nthe manner born, it is a custom\nMore honour'd in the breach than\nthe observance.\n    This heavy-\nheaded revel east and west\nMakes us traduc'd and tax'd of\nother nations;\n    They clip us\ndrunkards and with swinish\nphrase\n    Soil our addition;\nand indeed it takes\n    From our\nachievements, though perform'd\nat height,\n    The pith and\nmarrow of our attribute.\n    So\noft it chances in particular men\nThat, for some vicious mole of\nnature in them,\n    As in their\nbirth,- wherein they are not\nguilty,\n    Since nature cannot\nchoose his origin,-\n    By the\no'ergrowth of some complexion,\nOft breaking down the pales and\nforts of reason,\n    Or by some\nhabit that too much o'erleavens\nThe form of plausive manners,\nthat these men\n    Carrying, I\nsay, the stamp of one defect,\nBeing nature's livery, or\nfortune's star,\n    Their\nvirtues else- be they as pure as\ngrace,\n    As infinite as man\nmay undergo-  \n    Shall in the\ngeneral censure take corruption\nFrom that particular fault.

Angels\nand ministers of grace defend\nus!\n    Be thou a spirit of\nhealth or goblin damn'd,\nBring with thee airs from heaven\nor blasts from hell,\n    Be thy\nintents wicked or charitable,\nThou com'st in such a\nquestionable shape\n    That I\nwill speak to thee. I'll call\nthee Hamlet,\n    King, father,\nroyal Dane. O, answer me?\nLet me not burst in ignorance,\nbut tell\n    Why thy canoniz'd\nbones, hearsed in death,\nHave burst their cerements; why\nthe sepulchre\n    Wherein we saw\nthee quietly inurn'd,\n    Hath\nop'd his ponderous and marble\njaws\n    To cast thee up again.\nWhat may this mean  \n    That\nthou, dead corse, again in\ncomplete steel,\n    Revisits\nthus the glimpses of the moon,\nMaking night hideous, and we\nfools of nature\n    So horridly\nto shake our disposition\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches\nof our souls?\n    Say, why is\nthis? wherefore? What should we\ndo?\nGhost beckons Hamlet.\n  Hor. It\nbeckons you to go away with it,\nAs if it some impartment did\ndesire\n    To you alone.\n  Mar.\nLook with what courteous action\nIt waves you to a more removed\nground.\n    But do not go with\nit!\n  Hor. No, by no means!\nHam. It will not speak. Then\nwill I follow it.\n  Hor. Do not,\nmy lord!\n  Ham. Why, what should\nbe the fear?\n    I do not set my\nlife at a pin's fee;\n    And for\nmy soul, what can it do to that,\nBeing a thing immortal as\nitself?  \n    It waves me forth\nagain. I'll follow it.\n  Hor.\nWhat if it tempt you toward the\nflood, my lord,\n    Or to the\ndreadful summit of the cliff\nThat beetles o'er his base into\nthe sea,\n    And there assume\nsome other, horrible form\nWhich might deprive your\nsovereignty of reason\n    And\ndraw you into madness? Think of\nit.\n    The very place puts toys\nof desperation,\n    Without more\nmotive, into every brain\nThat looks so many fadoms to the\nsea\n    And hears it roar\nbeneath.\n  Ham. It waves me\nstill.\n    Go on. I'll follow\nthee.\n  Mar. You shall not go,\nmy lord.\n  Ham. Hold off your\nhands!\n  Hor. Be rul'd. You\nshall not go.\n  Ham. My fate\ncries out\n    And makes each\npetty artire in this body\n    As\nhardy as the Nemean lion's\nnerve.\n[Ghost beckons.]  \n    Still am\nI call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.\nBy heaven, I'll make a ghost of\nhim that lets me!-\n    I say,\naway!- Go on. I'll follow thee.\nExeunt Ghost and Hamlet.\n  Hor.\nHe waxes desperate with\nimagination.\n  Mar. Let's\nfollow. 'Tis not fit thus to\nobey him.\n  Hor. Have after. To\nwhat issue wail this come?\nMar. Something is rotten in the\nstate of Denmark.\n  Hor. Heaven\nwill direct it.\n  Mar. Nay,\nlet's follow him.\nExeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene V.\nElsinore.\nThe Castle. Another part of the\nfortifications.\n\nEnter Ghost and\nHamlet.\n\n  Ham. Whither wilt\nthou lead me? Speak! I'll go no\nfurther.\n  Ghost. Mark me.\nHam. I will.\n  Ghost. My hour is\nalmost come,\n    When I to\nsulph'rous and tormenting flames\nMust render up myself.\n  Ham.\nAlas, poor ghost!\n  Ghost. Pity\nme not, but lend thy serious\nhearing\n    To what I shall\nunfold.\n  Ham. Speak. I am bound\nto hear.\n  Ghost. So art thou to\nrevenge, when thou shalt hear.\nHam. What?\n  Ghost. I am thy\nfather's spirit,\n    Doom'd for\na certain term to walk the\nnight,\n    And for the day\nconfin'd to fast in fires,\nTill the foul crimes done in my\ndays of nature\n    Are burnt and\npurg'd away. But that I am\nforbid  \n    To tell the secrets\nof my prison house,\n    I could\na tale unfold whose lightest\nword\n    Would harrow up thy\nsoul, freeze thy young blood,\nMake thy two eyes, like stars,\nstart from their spheres,\nThy knotted and combined locks\nto part,\n    And each particular\nhair to stand an end\n    Like\nquills upon the fretful\nporpentine.\n    But this eternal\nblazon must not be\n    To ears\nof flesh and blood. List, list,\nO, list!\n    If thou didst ever\nthy dear father love-\n  Ham. O\nGod!\n  Ghost. Revenge his foul\nand most unnatural murther.\nHam. Murther?\n  Ghost. Murther\nmost foul, as in the best it is;\nBut this most foul, strange, and\nunnatural.\n  Ham. Haste me to\nknow't, that I, with wings as\nswift\n    As meditation or the\nthoughts of love,\n    May sweep\nto my revenge.\n  Ghost. I find\nthee apt;\n    And duller\nshouldst thou be than the fat\nweed  \n    That rots itself in\nease on Lethe wharf,\n    Wouldst\nthou not stir in this. Now,\nHamlet, hear.\n    'Tis given out\nthat, sleeping in my orchard,\nA serpent stung me. So the whole\near of Denmark\n    Is by a\nforged process of my death\nRankly abus'd. But know, thou\nnoble youth,\n    The serpent\nthat did sting thy father's life\nNow wears his crown.\n  Ham. O my\nprophetic soul!\n    My uncle?\nGhost. Ay, that incestuous, that\nadulterate beast,\n    With\nwitchcraft of his wit, with\ntraitorous gifts-\n    O wicked\nwit and gifts, that have the\npower\n    So to seduce!- won to\nhis shameful lust\n    The will\nof my most seeming-virtuous\nqueen.\n    O Hamlet, what a\nfalling-off was there,\n    From\nme, whose love was of that\ndignity\n    That it went hand in\nhand even with the vow\n    I\nmade to her in marriage, and to\ndecline\n    Upon a wretch whose\nnatural gifts were poor  \n    To\nthose of mine!\n    But virtue,\nas it never will be mov'd,\nThough lewdness court it in a\nshape of heaven,\n    So lust,\nthough to a radiant angel\nlink'd,\n    Will sate itself in\na celestial bed\n    And prey on\ngarbage.\n    But soft! methinks\nI scent the morning air.\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within\nmy orchard,\n    My custom always\nof the afternoon,\n    Upon my\nsecure hour thy uncle stole,\nWith juice of cursed hebona in a\nvial,\n    And in the porches of\nmy ears did pour\n    The\nleperous distilment; whose\neffect\n    Holds such an enmity\nwith blood of man\n    That swift\nas quicksilverr it courses\nthrough\n    The natural gates\nand alleys of the body,\n    And\nwith a sudden vigour it doth\nposset\n    And curd, like eager\ndroppings into milk,\n    The\nthin and wholesome blood. So did\nit mine;\n    And a most instant\ntetter bark'd about,  \n    Most\nlazar-like, with vile and\nloathsome crust\n    All my\nsmooth body.\n    Thus was I,\nsleeping, by a brother's hand\nOf life, of crown, of queen, at\nonce dispatch'd;\n    Cut off\neven in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhous'led, disappointed,\nunanel'd,\n    No reckoning made,\nbut sent to my account\n    With\nall my imperfections on my head.\nHam. O, horrible! O, horrible!\nmost horrible!\n  Ghost. If thou\nhast nature in thee, bear it\nnot.\n    Let not the royal bed\nof Denmark be\n    A couch for\nluxury and damned incest.\nBut, howsoever thou pursuest\nthis act,\n    Taint not thy\nmind, nor let thy soul contrive\nAgainst thy mother aught. Leave\nher to heaven,\n    And to those\nthorns that in her bosom lodge\nTo prick and sting her. Fare\nthee well at once.\n    The\nglowworm shows the matin to be\nnear\n    And gins to pale his\nuneffectual fire.\n    Adieu,\nadieu, adieu! Remember me.\nExit.  \n  Ham. O all you host of\nheaven! O earth! What else?\nAnd shall I couple hell? Hold,\nhold, my heart!\n    And you, my\nsinews, grow not instant old,\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember\nthee?\n    Ay, thou poor ghost,\nwhile memory holds a seat\n    In\nthis distracted globe. Remember\nthee?\n    Yea, from the table of\nmy memory\n    I'll wipe away all\ntrivial fond records,\n    All\nsaws of books, all forms, all\npressures past\n    That youth\nand observation copied there,\nAnd thy commandment all alone\nshall live\n    Within the book\nand volume of my brain,\nUnmix'd with baser matter. Yes,\nby heaven!\n    O most pernicious\nwoman!\n    O villain, villain,\nsmiling, damned villain!\n    My\ntables! Meet it is I set it down\nThat one may smile, and smile,\nand be a villain;\n    At least I\nam sure it may be so in Denmark.\n[Writes.]\n    So, uncle, there\nyou are. Now to my word:\n    It\nis 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'\nI have sworn't.\n  Hor. (within)\nMy lord, my lord!\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\nMar. Lord Hamlet!\n  Hor. Heaven\nsecure him!\n  Ham. So be it!\nMar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\nHam. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come,\nbird, come.\n  Mar. How is't, my\nnoble lord?\n  Hor. What news, my\nlord?\n  Mar. O, wonderful!\nHor. Good my lord, tell it.\nHam. No, you will reveal it.\nHor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!\nMar. Nor I, my lord.\n  Ham. How\nsay you then? Would heart of man\nonce think it?\n    But you'll be\nsecret?\n  Both. Ay, by heaven,\nmy lord.  \n  Ham. There's neer a\nvillain dwelling in all Denmark\nBut he's an arrant knave.\n  Hor.\nThere needs no ghost, my lord,\ncome from the grave\n    To tell\nus this.\n  Ham. Why, right! You\nare in the right!\n    And so,\nwithout more circumstance at\nall,\n    I hold it fit that we\nshake hands and part;\n    You,\nas your business and desires\nshall point you,\n    For every\nman hath business and desire,\nSuch as it is; and for my own\npoor part,\n    Look you, I'll go\npray.\n  Hor. These are but wild\nand whirling words, my lord.\nHam. I am sorry they offend you,\nheartily;\n    Yes, faith,\nheartily.\n  Hor. There's no\noffence, my lord.\n  Ham. Yes, by\nSaint Patrick, but there is,\nHoratio,\n    And much offence\ntoo. Touching this vision here,\nIt is an honest ghost, that let\nme tell you.\n    For your desire\nto know what is between us,\nO'ermaster't as you may. And\nnow, good friends,  \n    As you\nare friends, scholars, and\nsoldiers,\n    Give me one poor\nrequest.\n  Hor. What is't, my\nlord? We will.\n  Ham. Never make\nknown what you have seen to-\nnight.\n  Both. My lord, we will\nnot.\n  Ham. Nay, but swear't.\nHor. In faith,\n    My lord, not\nI.\n  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in\nfaith.\n  Ham. Upon my sword.\nMar. We have sworn, my lord,\nalready.\n  Ham. Indeed, upon my\nsword, indeed.\nGhost cries under the stage.\nGhost. Swear.\n  Ham. Aha boy,\nsay'st thou so? Art thou there,\ntruepenny?\n    Come on! You hear\nthis fellow in the cellarage.\nConsent to swear.\n  Hor. Propose\nthe oath, my lord.  \n  Ham.\nNever to speak of this that you\nhave seen.\n    Swear by my\nsword.\n  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.\nHam. Hic et ubique? Then we'll\nshift our ground.\n    Come\nhither, gentlemen,\n    And lay\nyour hands again upon my sword.\nNever to speak of this that you\nhave heard:\n    Swear by my\nsword.\n  Ghost.

And therefore as\na stranger give it welcome.\nThere are more things in heaven\nand earth, Horatio,\n    Than are\ndreamt of in your philosophy.\nBut come!\n    Here, as before,\nnever, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd soe'er I bear\nmyself\n    (As I perchance\nhereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on),\nThat you, at such times seeing\nme, never shall,\n    With arms\nencumb'red thus, or this head-\nshake,\n    Or by pronouncing of\nsome doubtful phrase,\n    As\n'Well, well, we know,' or 'We\ncould, an if we would,'\n    Or\n'If we list to speak,' or 'There\nbe, an if they might,'\n    Or\nsuch ambiguous giving out, to\nnote\n    That you know aught of\nme- this is not to do,\n    So\ngrace and mercy at your most\nneed help you,\n    Swear.\nGhost.

You\nshall do marvell's wisely, good\nReynaldo,\n    Before You visit\nhim, to make inquire\n    Of his\nbehaviour.\n  Rey. My lord, I did\nintend it.\n  Pol. Marry, well\nsaid, very well said. Look you,\nsir,\n    Enquire me first what\nDanskers are in Paris;\n    And\nhow, and who, what means, and\nwhere they keep,\n    What\ncompany, at what expense; and\nfinding\n    By this\nencompassment and drift of\nquestion\n    That they do know\nmy son, come you more nearer\nThan your particular demands\nwill touch it.\n    Take you, as\n'twere, some distant knowledge\nof him;\n    As thus, 'I know his\nfather and his friends,\n    And\nin part him.'

Ay, my lord,\n    I would\nknow that.\n  Pol. Marry, sir,\nhere's my drift,\n    And I\nbelieve it is a fetch of\nwarrant.\n    You laying these\nslight sullies on my son\n    As\n'twere a thing a little soil'd\ni' th' working,\n    Mark you,\nYour party in converse, him you\nwould sound,\n    Having ever\nseen in the prenominate crimes\nThe youth you breathe of guilty,\nbe assur'd\n    He closes with\nyou in this consequence:\n'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,'\nor 'gentleman'-\n    According to\nthe phrase or the addition\nOf man and country-\n  Rey. Very\ngood, my lord.\n  Pol. And then,\nsir, does 'a this- 'a does- What\nwas I about to say?\n    By the\nmass, I was about to say\nsomething! Where did I leave?\nRey.

At\n'closes in the consequence'- Ay,\nmarry!\n    He closes thus: 'I\nknow the gentleman.\n    I saw\nhim yesterday, or t'other day,\nOr then, or then, with such or\nsuch; and, as you say,\n    There\nwas 'a gaming; there o'ertook\nin's rouse;\n    There falling\nout at tennis'; or perchance,\n'I saw him enter such a house of\nsale,'\n    Videlicet, a brothel,\nor so forth.\n    See you now-\nYour bait of falsehood takes\nthis carp of truth;\n    And thus\ndo we of wisdom and of reach,\nWith windlasses and with assays\nof bias,\n    By indirections\nfind directions out.\n    So, by\nmy former lecture and advice,\nShall you my son.

O my lord, my lord, I have\nbeen so affrighted!\n  Pol. With\nwhat, i' th' name of God I\nOph. My lord, as I was sewing in\nmy closet,\n    Lord Hamlet, with\nhis doublet all unbrac'd,\n    No\nhat upon his head, his stockings\nfoul'd,\n    Ungart'red, and\ndown-gyved to his ankle;\nPale as his shirt, his knees\nknocking each other,\n    And\nwith a look so piteous in\npurport\n    As if he had been\nloosed out of hell\n    To speak\nof horrors- he comes before me.\nPol. Mad for thy love?  \n  Oph.\nMy lord, I do not know,\n    But\ntruly I do fear it.\n  Pol. What\nsaid he?\n  Oph. He took me by\nthe wrist and held me hard;\nThen goes he to the length of\nall his arm,\n    And, with his\nother hand thus o'er his brow,\nHe falls to such perusal of my\nface\n    As he would draw it.\nLong stay'd he so.\n    At last,\na little shaking of mine arm,\nAnd thrice his head thus waving\nup and down,\n    He rais'd a\nsigh so piteous and profound\nAs it did seem to shatter all\nhis bulk\n    And end his being.\nThat done, he lets me go,\nAnd with his head over his\nshoulder turn'd\n    He seem'd to\nfind his way without his eyes,\nFor out o' doors he went without\ntheir help\n    And to the last\nbended their light on me.\n  Pol.\nCome, go with me. I will go seek\nthe King.\n    This is the very\necstasy of love,\n    Whose\nviolent property fordoes itself\nAnd leads the will to desperate\nundertakings\n    As oft as any\npassion under heaven\n    That\ndoes afflict our natures. I am\nsorry.\n    What, have you given\nhim any hard words of late?\nOph. No, my good lord; but, as\nyou did command,\n    I did repel\nhis letters and denied\n    His\naccess to me.\n  Pol. That hath\nmade him mad.\n    I am sorry\nthat with better heed and\njudgment\n    I had not quoted\nhim. I fear'd he did but trifle\nAnd meant to wrack thee; but\nbeshrew my jealousy!\n    By\nheaven, it is as proper to our\nage\n    To cast beyond ourselves\nin our opinions\n    As it is\ncommon for the younger sort\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we\nto the King.\n    This must be\nknown; which, being kept close,\nmight move\n    More grief to\nhide than hate to utter love.\nCome.\nExeunt.\n\nScene II.\nElsinore.

No, I went\nround to work\n    And my young\nmistress thus I did bespeak:\n'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of\nthy star.\n    This must not be.'\nAnd then I prescripts gave her,\nThat she should lock herself\nfrom his resort,\n    Admit no\nmessengers, receive no tokens.\nWhich done, she took the fruits\nof my advice,\n    And he,\nrepulsed, a short tale to make,\nFell into a sadness, then into a\nfast,\n    Thence to a watch,\nthence into a weakness,\nThence to a lightness, and, by\nthis declension,\n    Into the\nmadness wherein now he raves,\nAnd all we mourn for.  \n  King.\nDo you think 'tis this?\n  Queen.\nit may be, very like.\n  Pol.\nHath there been such a time- I\nwould fain know that-\n    That I\nhave Positively said ''Tis so,'\nWhen it prov'd otherwise.?\nKing.

O, give me leave.\nExeunt King and Queen, [with\nAttendants].\n    How does my\ngood Lord Hamlet?\n  Ham. Well,\nGod-a-mercy.\n  Pol. Do you know\nme, my lord?\n  Ham. Excellent\nwell. You are a fishmonger.\nPol. Not I, my lord.\n  Ham. Then\nI would you were so honest a\nman.\n  Pol. Honest, my lord?\nHam. Ay, sir. To be honest, as\nthis world goes, is to be one\nman\n    pick'd out of ten\nthousand.\n  Pol. That's very\ntrue, my lord.\n  Ham. For if the\nsun breed maggots in a dead dog,\nbeing a god  \n    kissing\ncarrion- Have you a daughter?\nPol. I have, my lord.\n  Ham. Let\nher not walk i' th' sun.\nConception is a blessing, but\nnot\n    as your daughter may\nconceive. Friend, look to't.\nPol. [aside] How say you by\nthat? Still harping on my\ndaughter. Yet\n    he knew me not\nat first. He said I was a\nfishmonger. He is far\n    gone,\nfar gone! And truly in my youth\nI suff'red much extremity\nfor love- very near this. I'll\nspeak to him again.- What do you\nread, my lord?\n  Ham. Words,\nwords, words.\n  Pol. What is the\nmatter, my lord?\n  Ham. Between\nwho?\n  Pol. I mean, the matter\nthat you read, my lord.\n  Ham.\nSlanders, sir; for the satirical\nrogue says here that old men\nhave grey beards; that their\nfaces are wrinkled; their eyes\npurging thick amber and plum-\ntree gum; and that they have a\nplentiful lack of wit, together\nwith most weak hams. All which,\nsir, though I most powerfully\nand potently believe, yet I hold\nit\n    not honesty to have it\nthus set down; for you yourself,\nsir,\n    should be old as I am\nif, like a crab, you could go\nbackward.  \n  Pol. [aside]\nThough this be madness, yet\nthere is a method in't.-\n   Will\nYou walk out of the air, my\nlord?\n  Ham. Into my grave?\nPol. Indeed, that is out o' th'\nair. [Aside] How pregnant\nsometimes\n    his replies are! a\nhappiness that often madness\nhits on, which\n    reason and\nsanity could not so prosperously\nbe delivered of. I\n    will\nleave him and suddenly contrive\nthe means of meeting between\nhim and my daughter.- My\nhonourable lord, I will most\nhumbly take\n    my leave of you.\nHam. You cannot, sir, take from\nme anything that I will more\nwillingly part withal- except my\nlife, except my life, except my\nlife,\n\n                    Enter\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern.\nPol. Fare you well, my lord.\nHam. These tedious old fools!\nPol. You go to seek the Lord\nHamlet. There he is.\n  Ros. [to\nPolonius] God save you, sir!\nExit [Polonius].  \n  Guil. My\nhonour'd lord!\n  Ros. My most\ndear lord!\n  Ham. My excellent\ngood friends! How dost thou,\nGuildenstern? Ah,\nRosencrantz! Good lads, how do\nye both?\n  Ros. As the\nindifferent children of the\nearth.\n  Guil. Happy in that we\nare not over-happy.\n    On\nFortune's cap we are not the\nvery button.\n  Ham. Nor the\nsoles of her shoe?\n  Ros.\nNeither, my lord.\n  Ham. Then\nyou live about her waist, or in\nthe middle of her\n    favours?\nGuil. Faith, her privates we.\nHam. In the secret parts of\nFortune? O! most true! she is a\nstrumpet. What news ?\n  Ros.\nNone, my lord, but that the\nworld's grown honest.\n  Ham.\nThen is doomsday near! But your\nnews is not true. Let me\nquestion more in particular.\nWhat have you, my good friends,\ndeserved at the hands of Fortune\nthat she sends you to prison\nhither?\n  Guil. Prison, my lord?\nHam. Denmark's a prison.\n  Ros.\nThen is the world one.\n  Ham. A\ngoodly one; in which there are\nmany confines, wards, and\ndungeons, Denmark being one o'\nth' worst.\n  Ros. We think not\nso, my lord.\n  Ham. Why, then\n'tis none to you; for there is\nnothing either good\n    or bad\nbut thinking makes it so. To me\nit is a prison.\n  Ros. Why, then\nyour ambition makes it one. 'Tis\ntoo narrow for your\n    mind.\nHam. O God, I could be bounded\nin a nutshell and count myself a\nking of infinite space, were it\nnot that I have bad dreams.\nGuil. Which dreams indeed are\nambition; for the very substance\nof\n    the ambitious is merely\nthe shadow of a dream.\n  Ham. A\ndream itself is but a shadow.\nRos. Truly, and I hold ambition\nof so airy and light a quality\nthat\n    it is but a shadow's\nshadow.\n  Ham. Then are our\nbeggars bodies, and our monarchs\nand outstretch'd\n    heroes the\nbeggars' shadows. Shall we to\nth' court? for, by my\n    fay, I\ncannot reason.\n  Both. We'll\nwait upon you.  \n  Ham. No such\nmatter! I will not sort you with\nthe rest of my\n    servants;\nfor, to speak to you like an\nhonest man, I am most\ndreadfully attended. But in the\nbeaten way of friendship, what\nmake you at Elsinore?\n  Ros. To\nvisit you, my lord; no other\noccasion.\n  Ham. Beggar that I\nam, I am even poor in thanks;\nbut I thank you;\n    and sure,\ndear friends, my thanks are too\ndear a halfpenny. Were\n    you\nnot sent for? Is it your own\ninclining? Is it a free\nvisitation? Come, deal justly\nwith me. Come, come! Nay, speak.\nGuil. What should we say, my\nlord?\n  Ham. Why, anything- but\nto th' purpose. You were sent\nfor; and\n    there is a kind of\nconfession in your looks, which\nyour modesties\n    have not\ncraft enough to colour. I know\nthe good King and Queen\n    have\nsent for you.\n  Ros. To what\nend, my lord?\n  Ham. That you\nmust teach me. But let me\nconjure you by the rights\n    of\nour fellowship, by the\nconsonancy of our youth, by the\nobligation of our ever-preserved\nlove, and by what more dear a\nbetter proposer could charge you\nwithal, be even and direct with\nme, whether you were sent for or\nno.  \n  Ros. [aside to\nGuildenstern] What say you?\nHam. [aside] Nay then, I have an\neye of you.- If you love me,\nhold\n    not off.\n  Guil. My\nlord, we were sent for.\n  Ham. I\nwill tell you why. So shall my\nanticipation prevent your\ndiscovery, and your secrecy to\nthe King and Queen moult no\nfeather. I have of late- but\nwherefore I know not- lost all\nmy\n    mirth, forgone all custom\nof exercises; and indeed, it\ngoes so\n    heavily with my\ndisposition that this goodly\nframe, the earth,\n    seems to\nme a sterile promontory; this\nmost excellent canopy, the\nair, look you, this brave\no'erhanging firmament, this\nmajestical\n    roof fretted with\ngolden fire- why, it appeareth\nno other thing\n    to me than a\nfoul and pestilent congregation\nof vapours. What a\n    piece of\nwork is a man! how noble in\nreason! how infinite in\nfaculties! in form and moving\nhow express and admirable! in\naction how like an angel! in\napprehension how like a god! the\nbeauty of the world, the paragon\nof animals! And yet to me what\nis this quintessence of dust?\nMan delights not me- no, nor\nwoman\n    neither, though by\nyour smiling you seem to say so.\nRos. My lord, there was no such\nstuff in my thoughts.  \n  Ham.\nWhy did you laugh then, when I\nsaid 'Man delights not me'?\nRos. To think, my lord, if you\ndelight not in man, what lenten\nentertainment the players shall\nreceive from you. We coted them\non the way, and hither are they\ncoming to offer you service.\nHam. He that plays the king\nshall be welcome- his Majesty\nshall\n    have tribute of me;\nthe adventurous knight shall use\nhis foil and\n    target; the\nlover shall not sigh gratis; the\nhumorous man shall\n    end his\npart in peace; the clown shall\nmake those laugh whose\n    lungs\nare tickle o' th' sere; and the\nlady shall say her mind\nfreely, or the blank verse shall\nhalt fort. What players are\nthey?\n  Ros. Even those you were\nwont to take such delight in,\nthe\n    tragedians of the city.\nHam. How chances it they travel?\nTheir residence, both in\nreputation and profit, was\nbetter both ways.\n  Ros. I think\ntheir inhibition comes by the\nmeans of the late\ninnovation.\n  Ham. Do they hold\nthe same estimation they did\nwhen I was in the\n    city? Are\nthey so follow'd?\n  Ros. No\nindeed are they not.  \n  Ham.\nHow comes it? Do they grow\nrusty?\n  Ros. Nay, their\nendeavour keeps in the wonted\npace; but there is,\n    sir, an\neyrie of children, little\neyases, that cry out on the top\nof question and are most\ntyrannically clapp'd fort. These\nare now\n    the fashion, and so\nberattle the common stages (so\nthey call\n    them) that many\nwearing rapiers are afraid of\ngoosequills and\n    dare scarce\ncome thither.\n  Ham. What, are\nthey children? Who maintains\n'em? How are they\n    escoted?\nWill they pursue the quality no\nlonger than they can\n    sing?\nWill they not say afterwards, if\nthey should grow\n    themselves\nto common players (as it is most\nlike, if their means\n    are no\nbetter), their writers do them\nwrong to make them exclaim\nagainst their own succession.\nRos. Faith, there has been much\nto do on both sides; and the\nnation\n    holds it no sin to\ntarre them to controversy. There\nwas, for a\n    while, no money\nbid for argument unless the poet\nand the player\n    went to cuffs\nin the question.\n  Ham. Is't\npossible?\n  Guil. O, there has\nbeen much throwing about of\nbrains.\n  Ham. Do the boys carry\nit away?  \n  Ros. Ay, that they\ndo, my lord- Hercules and his\nload too.\n  Ham. It is not very\nstrange; for my uncle is King of\nDenmark, and\n    those that\nwould make mows at him while my\nfather lived give\n    twenty,\nforty, fifty, a hundred ducats\napiece for his picture in\nlittle. 'Sblood, there is\nsomething in this more than\nnatural, if\n    philosophy could\nfind it out.\nFlourish for the Players.\nGuil. There are the players.\nHam. Gentlemen, you are welcome\nto Elsinore. Your hands, come!\nTh'\n    appurtenance of welcome\nis fashion and ceremony. Let me\ncomply\n    with you in this\ngarb, lest my extent to the\nplayers (which I\n    tell you\nmust show fairly outwards)\nshould more appear like\nentertainment than yours. You\nare welcome. But my uncle-father\nand aunt-mother are deceiv'd.\nGuil. In what, my dear lord?\nHam. I am but mad north-north-\nwest. When the wind is southerly\nI\n    know a hawk from a\nhandsaw.\nEnter Polonius.\n\n  Pol. Well be\nwith you, gentlemen!\n  Ham. Hark\nyou, Guildenstern- and you too-\nat each ear a hearer!\n    That\ngreat baby you see there is not\nyet out of his swaddling\nclouts.\n  Ros. Happily he's the\nsecond time come to them; for\nthey say an old\n    man is twice\na child.\n  Ham. I will prophesy\nhe comes to tell me of the\nplayers. Mark it.-\n   You say\nright, sir; a Monday morning;\ntwas so indeed.\n  Pol. My lord,\nI have news to tell you.\n  Ham.\nMy lord, I have news to tell\nyou. When Roscius was an actor\nin\n    Rome-\n  Pol. The actors\nare come hither, my lord.\n  Ham.\nBuzz, buzz!\n  Pol. Upon my\nhonour-\n  Ham. Then came each\nactor on his ass-\n  Pol. The\nbest actors in the world, either\nfor tragedy, comedy,\nhistory, pastoral, pastoral-\ncomical, historical-pastoral,\ntragical-historical, tragical-\ncomical-historical-pastoral;\nscene  \n    individable, or poem\nunlimited.

You\n    would\nplay upon me; you would seem to\nknow my stops; you would\npluck out the heart of my\nmystery; you would sound me from\nmy\n    lowest note to the top of\nmy compass; and there is much\nmusic,  \n    excellent voice, in\nthis little organ, yet cannot\nyou make it\n    speak.

Dead for a ducat, dead!\n[Makes a pass through the arras\nand] kills Polonius.\n  Pol.\n[behind] O, I am slain!\n  Queen.\nO me, what hast thou done?\nHam. Nay, I know not. Is it the\nKing?\n  Queen. O, what a rash\nand bloody deed is this!\n  Ham.\nA bloody deed- almost as bad,\ngood mother,\n    As kill a king,\nand marry with his brother.\nQueen. As kill a king?\n  Ham.\nAy, lady, it was my word.\n[Lifts up the arras and sees\nPolonius.]\n    Thou wretched,\nrash, intruding fool, farewell!\nI took thee for thy better. Take\nthy fortune.\n    Thou find'st to\nbe too busy is some danger.\nLeave wringing of your hinds.\nPeace! sit you down\n    And let\nme wring your heart; for so I\nshall\n    If it be made of\npenetrable stuff;\n    If damned\ncustom have not braz'd it so\nThat it is proof and bulwark\nagainst sense.\n  Queen. What\nhave I done that thou dar'st wag\nthy tongue\n    In noise so rude\nagainst me?\n  Ham. Such an act\nThat blurs the grace and blush\nof modesty;\n    Calls virtue\nhypocrite; takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an\ninnocent love,\n    And sets a\nblister there; makes marriage\nvows\n    As false as dicers'\noaths. O, such a deed\n    As\nfrom the body of contraction\nplucks  \n    The very soul, and\nsweet religion makes\n    A\nrhapsody of words! Heaven's face\ndoth glow;\n    Yea, this\nsolidity and compound mass,\nWith tristful visage, as against\nthe doom,\n    Is thought-sick at\nthe act.\n  Queen. Ay me, what\nact,\n    That roars so loud and\nthunders in the index?\n  Ham.\nLook here upon th's picture, and\non this,\n    The counterfeit\npresentment of two brothers.\nSee what a grace was seated on\nthis brow;\n    Hyperion's curls;\nthe front of Jove himself;\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten\nand command;\n    A station like\nthe herald Mercury\n    New\nlighted on a heaven-kissing\nhill:\n    A combination and a\nform indeed\n    Where every god\ndid seem to set his seal\n    To\ngive the world assurance of a\nman.\n    This was your husband.\nLook you now what follows.\nHere is your husband, like a\nmildew'd ear\n    Blasting his\nwholesome brother. Have you\neyes?  \n    Could you on this\nfair mountain leave to feed,\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha!\nhave you eyes\n    You cannot\ncall it love; for at your age\nThe heyday in the blood is tame,\nit's humble,\n    And waits upon\nthe judgment; and what judgment\nWould step from this to this?\nSense sure you have,\n    Else\ncould you not have motion; but\nsure that sense\n    Is\napoplex'd; for madness would not\nerr,\n    Nor sense to ecstacy\nwas ne'er so thrall'd\n    But it\nreserv'd some quantity of choice\nTo serve in such a difference.\nWhat devil was't\n    That thus\nhath cozen'd you at hoodman-\nblind?\n    Eyes without feeling,\nfeeling without sight,\n    Ears\nwithout hands or eyes, smelling\nsans all,\n    Or but a sickly\npart of one true sense\n    Could\nnot so mope.\n    O shame! where\nis thy blush? Rebellious hell,\nIf thou canst mutine in a\nmatron's bones,\n    To flaming\nyouth let virtue be as wax\nAnd melt in her own fire.\nProclaim no shame  \n    When the\ncompulsive ardour gives the\ncharge,\n    Since frost itself\nas actively doth burn,\n    And\nreason panders will.\n  Queen. O\nHamlet, speak no more!\n    Thou\nturn'st mine eyes into my very\nsoul,\n    And there I see such\nblack and grained spots\n    As\nwill not leave their tinct.\nHam. Nay, but to live\n    In the\nrank sweat of an enseamed bed,\nStew'd in corruption, honeying\nand making love\n    Over the\nnasty sty!\n  Queen. O, speak to\nme no more!\n    These words like\ndaggers enter in mine ears.\nNo more, sweet Hamlet!\n  Ham. A\nmurtherer and a villain!\n    A\nslave that is not twentieth part\nthe tithe\n    Of your precedent\nlord; a vice of kings;\n    A\ncutpurse of the empire and the\nrule,\n    That from a shelf the\nprecious diadem stole\n    And\nput it in his pocket!  \n  Queen.\nNo more!\n\n                Enter\nthe Ghost in his nightgown.\nHam. A king of shreds and\npatches!-\n    Save me and hover\no'er me with your wings,\n    You\nheavenly guards! What would your\ngracious figure?\n  Queen. Alas,\nhe's mad!\n  Ham. Do you not come\nyour tardy son to chide,\nThat, laps'd in time and\npassion, lets go by\n    Th'\nimportant acting of your dread\ncommand?\n    O, say!\n  Ghost. Do\nnot forget. This visitation\nIs but to whet thy almost\nblunted purpose.\n    But look,\namazement on thy mother sits.\nO, step between her and her\nfighting soul\n    Conceit in\nweakest bodies strongest works.\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\n  Ham. How\nis it with you, lady?\n  Queen.\nAlas, how is't with you,\nThat you do bend your eye on\nvacancy,\n    And with th'\nencorporal air do hold\ndiscourse?\n    Forth at your\neyes your spirits wildly peep;\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in\nth' alarm,\n    Your bedded\nhairs, like life in excrements,\nStart up and stand an end. O\ngentle son,\n    Upon the beat\nand flame of thy distemper\nSprinkle cool patience! Whereon\ndo you look?\n  Ham. On him, on\nhim! Look you how pale he\nglares!\n    His form and cause\nconjoin'd, preaching to stones,\nWould make them capable.- Do not\nlook upon me,\n    Lest with this\npiteous action you convert\nMy stern effects. Then what I\nhave to do\n    Will want true\ncolour- tears perchance for\nblood.\n  Queen. To whom do you\nspeak this?\n  Ham. Do you see\nnothing there?\n  Queen. Nothing\nat all; yet all that is I see.\nHam. Nor did you nothing hear?\nQueen. No, nothing but\nourselves.\n  Ham. Why, look you\nthere! Look how it steals away!\nMy father, in his habit as he\nliv'd!\n    Look where he goes\neven now out at the portal!\nExit Ghost.\n  Queen. This is the\nvery coinage of your brain.\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\nIs very cunning in.\n  Ham.\nEcstasy?\n    My pulse as yours\ndoth temperately keep time\nAnd makes as healthful music. It\nis not madness\n    That I have\nutt'red. Bring me to the test,\nAnd I the matter will reword;\nwhich madness\n    Would gambol\nfrom. Mother, for love of grace,\nLay not that flattering unction\nto your soul\n    That not your\ntrespass but my madness speaks.\nIt will but skin and film the\nulcerous place,\n    Whiles rank\ncorruption, mining all within,\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself\nto heaven;\n    Repent what's\npast; avoid what is to come;\nAnd do not spread the compost on\nthe weeds\n    To make them\nranker. Forgive me this my\nvirtue;  \n    For in the fatness\nof these pursy times\n    Virtue\nitself of vice must pardon beg-\nYea, curb and woo for leave to\ndo him good.\n  Queen. O Hamlet,\nthou hast cleft my heart in\ntwain.\n  Ham. O, throw away the\nworser part of it,\n    And live\nthe purer with the other half,\nGood night- but go not to my\nuncle's bed.\n    Assume a\nvirtue, if you have it not.\nThat monster, custom, who all\nsense doth eat\n    Of habits\nevil, is angel yet in this,\nThat to the use of actions fair\nand good\n    He likewise gives a\nfrock or livery,\n    That aptly\nis put on. Refrain to-night,\nAnd that shall lend a kind of\neasiness\n    To the next\nabstinence; the next more easy;\nFor use almost can change the\nstamp of nature,\n    And either\n[master] the devil, or throw him\nout\n    With wondrous potency.\nOnce more, good night;\n    And\nwhen you are desirous to be\nblest,\n    I'll blessing beg of\nyou.- For this same lord,\nI do repent; but heaven hath\npleas'd it so,\n    To punish me\nwith this, and this with me,\nThat I must be their scourge and\nminister.\n    I will bestow him,\nand will answer well\n    The\ndeath I gave him. So again, good\nnight.\n    I must be cruel, only\nto be kind;\n    Thus bad begins,\nand worse remains behind.\nOne word more, good lady.\nQueen. What shall I do?\n  Ham.\nNot this, by no means, that I\nbid you do:\n    Let the bloat\nKing tempt you again to bed;\nPinch wanton on your cheek; call\nyou his mouse;\n    And let him,\nfor a pair of reechy kisses,\nOr paddling in your neck with\nhis damn'd fingers,\n    Make you\nto ravel all this matter out,\nThat I essentially am not in\nmadness,\n    But mad in craft.\n'Twere good you let him know;\nFor who that's but a queen,\nfair, sober, wise,\n    Would\nfrom a paddock, from a bat, a\ngib\n    Such dear concernings\nhide? Who would do so?  \n    No,\nin despite of sense and secrecy,\nUnpeg the basket on the house's\ntop,\n    Let the birds fly, and\nlike the famous ape,\n    To try\nconclusions, in the basket creep\nAnd break your own neck down.\nQueen. Be thou assur'd, if words\nbe made of breath,\n    And\nbreath of life, I have no life\nto breathe\n    What thou hast\nsaid to me.\n  Ham. I must to\nEngland; you know that?\n  Queen.\nAlack,\n    I had forgot! 'Tis so\nconcluded on.\n  Ham. There's\nletters seal'd; and my two\nschoolfellows,\n    Whom I will\ntrust as I will adders fang'd,\nThey bear the mandate; they must\nsweep my way\n    And marshal me\nto knavery.

That I can keep your\ncounsel, and not mine own.\nBesides, to be\n    demanded of a\nsponge, what replication should\nbe made by the son\n    of a\nking?\n  Ros. Take you me for a\nsponge, my lord?\n  Ham. Ay, sir;\nthat soaks up the King's\ncountenance, his rewards,\nhis authorities. But such\nofficers do the King best\nservice in\n    the end.

The Queen\nhis mother\n    Lives almost by\nhis looks; and for myself,-\nMy virtue or my plague, be it\neither which,-\n    She's so\nconjunctive to my life and soul\nThat, as the star moves not but\nin his sphere,  \n    I could not\nbut by her. The other motive\nWhy to a public count I might\nnot go\n    Is the great love the\ngeneral gender bear him,\nWho, dipping all his faults in\ntheir affection,\n    Would, like\nthe spring that turneth wood to\nstone,\n    Convert his gives to\ngraces; so that my arrows,\nToo slightly timber'd for so\nloud a wind,\n    Would have\nreverted to my bow again,\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\nLaer.

But let him come!\n    It\nwarms the very sickness in my\nheart\n    That I shall live and\ntell him to his teeth,\n    'Thus\ndidest thou.'\n  King. If it be\nso, Laertes\n    (As how should\nit be so? how otherwise?),\nWill you be rul'd by me?\n  Laer.\nAy my lord,\n    So you will not\no'errule me to a peace.\n  King.\nTo thine own peace.

A very riband in the cap\nof youth-\n    Yet needfull too;\nfor youth no less becomes\nThe light and careless livery\nthat it wears\n    Thin settled\nage his sables and his weeds,\nImporting health and graveness.\nTwo months since\n    Here was a\ngentleman of Normandy.\n    I\nhave seen myself, and serv'd\nagainst, the French,\n    And\nthey can well on horseback; but\nthis gallant  \n    Had\nwitchcraft in't. He grew unto\nhis seat,\n    And to such\nwondrous doing brought his horse\nAs had he been incorps'd and\ndemi-natur'd\n    With the brave\nbeast. So far he topp'd my\nthought\n    That I, in forgery\nof shapes and tricks,\n    Come\nshort of what he did.\n  Laer. A\nNorman was't?\n  King. A Norman.\nLaer. Upon my life, Lamound.\nKing. The very same.\n  Laer. I\nknow him well. He is the broach\nindeed\n    And gem of all the\nnation.\n  King. He made\nconfession of you;\n    And gave\nyou such a masterly report\nFor art and exercise in your\ndefence,\n    And for your rapier\nmost especially,\n    That he\ncried out 'twould be a sight\nindeed\n    If one could match\nyou. The scrimers of their\nnation\n    He swore had neither\nmotion, guard, nor eye,\n    If\nyou oppos'd them. Sir, this\nreport of his  \n    Did Hamlet\nso envenom with his envy\nThat he could nothing do but\nwish and beg\n    Your sudden\ncoming o'er to play with you.\nNow, out of this-\n  Laer. What\nout of this, my lord?\n  King.\nLaertes, was your father dear to\nyou?\n    Or are you like the\npainting of a sorrow,\n    A face\nwithout a heart,'\n  Laer. Why\nask you this?\n  King. Not that I\nthink you did not love your\nfather;\n    But that I know love\nis begun by time,\n    And that I\nsee, in passages of proof,\nTime qualifies the spark and\nfire of it.\n    There lives\nwithin the very flame of love\nA kind of wick or snuff that\nwill abate it;\n    And nothing\nis at a like goodness still;\nFor goodness, growing to a\nplurisy,\n    Dies in his own\ntoo-much. That we would do,\nWe should do when we would; for\nthis 'would' changes,\n    And\nhath abatements and delays as\nmany  \n    As there are tongues,\nare hands, are accidents;\nAnd then this 'should' is like a\nspendthrift sigh,\n    That hurts\nby easing. But to the quick o'\nth' ulcer!\n    Hamlet comes\nback. What would you undertake\nTo show yourself your father's\nson in deed\n    More than in\nwords?\n  Laer. To cut his throat\ni' th' church!\n  King. No place\nindeed should murther\nsanctuarize;\n    Revenge should\nhave no bounds. But, good\nLaertes,\n    Will you do this?\nKeep close within your chamber.\nWill return'd shall know you are\ncome home.\n    We'll put on\nthose shall praise your\nexcellence\n    And set a double\nvarnish on the fame\n    The\nFrenchman gave you; bring you in\nfine together\n    And wager on\nyour heads. He, being remiss,\nMost generous, and free from all\ncontriving,\n    Will not peruse\nthe foils; so that with ease,\nOr with a little shuffling, you\nmay choose\n    A sword unbated,\nand, in a pass of practice,\nRequite him for your father.\nLaer. I will do't!\n    And for\nthat purpose I'll anoint my\nsword.\n    I bought an unction\nof a mountebank,\n    So mortal\nthat, but dip a knife in it,\nWhere it draws blood no\ncataplasm so rare,\n    Collected\nfrom all simples that have\nvirtue\n    Under the moon, can\nsave the thing from death\nThis is but scratch'd withal.\nI'll touch my point\n    With\nthis contagion, that, if I gall\nhim slightly,\n    It may be\ndeath.\n  King. Let's further\nthink of this,\n    Weigh what\nconvenience both of time and\nmeans\n    May fit us to our\nshape. If this should fall,\nAnd that our drift look through\nour bad performance.\n    'Twere\nbetter not assay'd.

Her clothes spread wide\nAnd, mermaid-like, awhile they\nbore her up;\n    Which time she\nchaunted snatches of old tunes,\nAs one incapable of her own\ndistress,\n    Or like a creature\nnative and indued\n    Unto that\nelement; but long it could not\nbe\n    Till that her garments,\nheavy with their drink,\nPull'd the poor wretch from her\nmelodious lay\n    To muddy\ndeath.\n  Laer.

How\ncan that be, unless she drown'd\nherself in her own\n    defence?\nOther. Why, 'tis found so.\nClown. It must be se offendendo;\nit cannot be else.

Has\nthis fellow no feeling of his\nbusiness, that he sings at\ngrave-making?\n  Hor. Custom hath\nmade it in him a Property of\neasiness.\n  Ham. 'Tis e'en so.\nThe hand of little employment\nhath the daintier\n    sense.\nClown. (sings)\n         But age\nwith his stealing steps\nHath clawed me in his clutch,\nAnd hath shipped me intil the\nland,\n           As if I had\nnever been such.\n[Throws up a skull.]\n  \n  Ham.\nThat skull had a tongue in it,\nand could sing once. How the\nknave jowls it to the ground,as\nif 'twere Cain's jawbone, that\ndid the first murther! This\nmight be the pate of a\nPolitician,\n    which this ass\nnow o'erreaches; one that would\ncircumvent God,\n    might it\nnot?\n  Hor. It might, my lord.\nHam. Or of a courtier, which\ncould say 'Good morrow, sweet\nlord!\n    How dost thou, good\nlord?' This might be my Lord\nSuch-a-one, that\n    prais'd my\nLord Such-a-one's horse when he\nmeant to beg it- might\n    it\nnot?\n  Hor. Ay, my lord.\n  Ham.\nWhy, e'en so! and now my Lady\nWorm's, chapless, and knock'd\nabout the mazzard with a\nsexton's spade. Here's fine\nrevolution,\n    and we had the\ntrick to see't. Did these bones\ncost no more the\n    breeding\nbut to play at loggets with 'em?\nMine ache to think\n    on't.\nClown. (Sings)\n         A\npickaxe and a spade, a spade,\nFor and a shrouding sheet;\nO, a Pit of clay for to be made\nFor such a guest is meet.\nThrows up [another skull].\nHam. There's another. Why may\nnot that be the skull of a\nlawyer?\n    Where be his\nquiddits now, his quillets, his\ncases, his tenures,\n    and his\ntricks? Why does he suffer this\nrude knave now to knock\n    him\nabout the sconce with a dirty\nshovel, and will not tell him\nof his action of battery? Hum!\nThis fellow might be in's time a\ngreat buyer of land, with his\nstatutes, his recognizances, his\nfines, his double vouchers, his\nrecoveries. Is this the fine of\nhis fines, and the recovery of\nhis recoveries, to have his fine\npate full of fine dirt? Will his\nvouchers vouch him no more of\nhis purchases, and double ones\ntoo, than the length and breadth\nof a pair of indentures? The\nvery conveyances of his lands\nwill\n    scarcely lie in this\nbox; and must th' inheritor\nhimself have no\n    more, ha?\nHor. Not a jot more, my lord.\nHam. Is not parchment made of\nsheepskins?\n  Hor. Ay, my lord,\nAnd of calveskins too.\n  Ham.\nThey are sheep and calves which\nseek out assurance in that. I\nwill speak to this fellow. Whose\ngrave's this, sirrah?\n  Clown.\nMine, sir.\n\n    [Sings] O, a pit\nof clay for to be made\nFor such a guest is meet.\nHam. I think it be thine indeed,\nfor thou liest in't.\n  Clown.\nYou lie out on't, sir, and\ntherefore 'tis not yours.\nFor my part, I do not lie in't,\nyet it is mine.\n  Ham. Thou dost\nlie in't, to be in't and say it\nis thine. 'Tis for\n    the dead,\nnot for the quick; therefore\nthou liest.\n  Clown. 'Tis a\nquick lie, sir; 'twill away\nagain from me to you.\n  Ham.\nWhat man dost thou dig it for?\nClown. For no man, sir.\n  Ham.\nWhat woman then?\n  Clown. For\nnone neither.\n  Ham. Who is to\nbe buried in't?\n  Clown. One\nthat was a woman, sir; but, rest\nher soul, she's dead.\n  Ham. How\nabsolute the knave is! We must\nspeak by the card, or\nequivocation will undo us. By\nthe Lord, Horatio, this three\nyears\n    I have taken note of\nit, the age is grown so picked\nthat the toe  \n    of the\npeasant comes so near the heel\nof the courtier he galls\n    his\nkibe.- How long hast thou been a\ngrave-maker?\n  Clown. Of all the\ndays i' th' year, I came to't\nthat day that our\n    last king\nHamlet overcame Fortinbras.\nHam. How long is that since?\nClown. Cannot you tell that?\nEvery fool can tell that. It was\nthe\n    very day that young\nHamlet was born- he that is mad,\nand sent\n    into England.\nHam. Ay, marry, why was be sent\ninto England?\n  Clown. Why,\nbecause 'a was mad. 'A shall\nrecover his wits there;\n    or,\nif 'a do not, 'tis no great\nmatter there.\n  Ham. Why?\nClown. 'Twill not he seen in him\nthere. There the men are as mad\nas\n    he.\n  Ham. How came he\nmad?\n  Clown. Very strangely,\nthey say.\n  Ham. How strangely?\nClown. Faith, e'en with losing\nhis wits.\n  Ham. Upon what\nground?\n  Clown. Why, here in\nDenmark. I have been sexton\nhere, man and boy  \n    thirty\nyears.\n  Ham. How long will a\nman lie i' th' earth ere he rot?\nClown. Faith, if 'a be not\nrotten before 'a die (as we have\nmany\n    pocky corses now-a-days\nthat will scarce hold the laying\nin, I\n    will last you some\neight year or nine year. A\ntanner will last\n    you nine\nyear.\n  Ham. Why he more than\nanother?\n  Clown. Why, sir, his\nhide is so tann'd with his trade\nthat 'a will\n    keep out water\na great while; and your water is\na sore decayer of\n    your\nwhoreson dead body. Here's a\nskull now. This skull hath lien\nyou i' th' earth three-and-\ntwenty years.\n  Ham. Whose was\nit?\n  Clown. A whoreson, mad\nfellow's it was. Whose do you\nthink it was?\n  Ham. Nay, I know\nnot.\n  Clown. A pestilence on\nhim for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a\nflagon of\n    Rhenish on my head\nonce. This same skull, sir, was\nYorick's\n    skull, the King's\njester.\n  Ham. This?\n  Clown.\nE'en that.\n  Ham. Let me see.\n[Takes the skull.] Alas, poor\nYorick! I knew him,\nHoratio. A fellow of infinite\njest, of most excellent fancy.\nHe\n    hath borne me on his back\na thousand tunes. And now how\nabhorred\n    in my imagination\nit is! My gorge rises at it.\nHere hung those\n    lips that I\nhave kiss'd I know not how oft.\nWhere be your gibes\n    now?\nyour gambols? your songs? your\nflashes of merriment that\nwere wont to set the table on a\nroar? Not one now, to mock your\nown grinning? Quite chap-\nfall'n? Now get you to my lady's\nchamber, and tell her, let her\npaint an inch thick, to this\nfavour she must come. Make her\nlaugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,\ntell me one thing.\n  Hor. What's\nthat, my lord?\n  Ham. Dost thou\nthink Alexander look'd o' this\nfashion i' th' earth?\n  Hor.\nE'en so.\n  Ham. And smelt so?\nPah!\n[Puts down the skull.]\n  Hor.\nE'en so, my lord.\n  Ham. To what\nbase uses we may return,\nHoratio! Why may not\nimagination trace the noble dust\nof Alexander till he find it\nstopping a bunghole?\n  Hor.\n'Twere to consider too\ncuriously, to consider so.\nHam. No, faith, not a jot; but\nto follow him thither with\nmodesty\n    enough, and\nlikelihood to lead it; as thus:\nAlexander died,\n    Alexander\nwas buried, Alexander returneth\ninto dust; the dust is\nearth; of earth we make loam;\nand why of that loam (whereto he\nwas converted) might they not\nstop a beer barrel?\nImperious Caesar, dead and\nturn'd to clay,\n    Might stop a\nhole to keep the wind away.\nO, that that earth which kept\nthe world in awe\n    Should\npatch a wall t' expel the\nwinter's flaw!\n    But soft! but\nsoft! aside! Here comes the\nKing-\n\n    Enter [priests with]\na coffin [in funeral\nprocession], King,\nQueen, Laertes, with Lords\nattendant.]\n\n    The Queen, the\ncourtiers. Who is this they\nfollow?\n    And with such maimed\nrites? This doth betoken\n    The\ncorse they follow did with\ndesp'rate hand\n    Fordo it own\nlife. 'Twas of some estate.\nCouch we awhile, and mark.\n[Retires with Horatio.]\nLaer. What ceremony else?\n  Ham.\nThat is Laertes,\n    A very\nnoble youth. Mark.\n  Laer. What\nceremony else?\n  Priest. Her\nobsequies have been as far\nenlarg'd\n    As we have\nwarranty. Her death was\ndoubtful;\n    And, but that\ngreat command o'ersways the\norder,\n    She should in ground\nunsanctified have lodg'd\nTill the last trumpet. For\ncharitable prayers,\n    Shards,\nflints, and pebbles should be\nthrown on her.\n    Yet here she\nis allow'd her virgin crants,\nHer maiden strewments, and the\nbringing home\n    Of bell and\nburial.\n  Laer. Must there no\nmore be done?\n  Priest. No more\nbe done.\n    We should profane\nthe service of the dead\n    To\nsing a requiem and such rest to\nher\n    As to peace-parted\nsouls.\n  Laer. Lay her i' th'\nearth;\n    And from her fair and\nunpolluted flesh  \n    May\nviolets spring! I tell thee,\nchurlish priest,\n    A\nminist'ring angel shall my\nsister be\n    When thou liest\nhowling.\n  Ham. What, the fair\nOphelia?\n  Queen. Sweets to the\nsweet! Farewell.\n[Scatters flowers.]\n    I hop'd\nthou shouldst have been my\nHamlet's wife;\n    I thought thy\nbride-bed to have deck'd, sweet\nmaid,\n    And not have strew'd\nthy grave.\n  Laer. O, treble woe\nFall ten times treble on that\ncursed head\n    Whose wicked\ndeed thy most ingenious sense\nDepriv'd thee of! Hold off the\nearth awhile,\n    Till I have\ncaught her once more in mine\narms.\nLeaps in the grave.\n    Now pile\nyour dust upon the quick and\ndead\n    Till of this flat a\nmountain you have made\n    T'\no'ertop old Pelion or the skyish\nhead\n    Of blue Olympus.\n  Ham.\n[comes forward] What is he whose\ngrief  \n    Bears such an\nemphasis? whose phrase of sorrow\nConjures the wand'ring stars,\nand makes them stand\n    Like\nwonder-wounded hearers? This is\nI,\n    Hamlet the Dane.\n[Leaps in after Laertes.\n  Laer.\nThe devil take thy soul!\n[Grapples with him].\n  Ham. Thou\npray'st not well.\n    I prithee\ntake thy fingers from my throat;\nFor, though I am not splenitive\nand rash,\n    Yet have I in me\nsomething dangerous,\n    Which\nlet thy wisdom fear.

Hear you, sir!\n    What is\nthe reason that you use me thus?\nI lov'd you ever. But it is no\nmatter.\n    Let Hercules himself\ndo what he may,\n    The cat will\nmew, and dog will have his day.\nExit.\n  King.

So\nmuch for this, sir; now shall\nyou see the other.\n    You do\nremember all the circumstance?\nHor. Remember it, my lord!\nHam. Sir, in my heart there was\na kind of fighting\n    That\nwould not let me sleep.\nMethought I lay\n    Worse than\nthe mutinies in the bilboes.\nRashly-\n    And prais'd be\nrashness for it; let us know,\nOur indiscretion sometime serves\nus well\n    When our deep plots\ndo pall; and that should learn\nus\n    There's a divinity that\nshapes our ends,\n    Rough-hew\nthem how we will-\n  Hor. That is\nmost certain.\n  Ham. Up from my\ncabin,\n    My sea-gown scarf'd\nabout me, in the dark\n    Grop'd\nI to find out them; had my\ndesire,\n    Finger'd their\npacket, and in fine withdrew\nTo mine own room again; making\nso bold  \n    (My fears\nforgetting manners) to unseal\nTheir grand commission; where I\nfound, Horatio\n    (O royal\nknavery!), an exact command,\nLarded with many several sorts\nof reasons,\n    Importing\nDenmark's health, and England's\ntoo,\n    With, hoo! such bugs\nand goblins in my life-\nThat, on the supervise, no\nleisure bated,\n    No, not to\nstay the finding of the axe,\nMy head should be struck off.\nHor. Is't possible?\n  Ham.\nHere's the commission; read it\nat more leisure.\n    But wilt\nthou bear me how I did proceed?\nHor. I beseech you.\n  Ham. Being\nthus benetted round with\nvillanies,\n    Or I could make a\nprologue to my brains,\n    They\nhad begun the play. I sat me\ndown;\n    Devis'd a new\ncommission; wrote it fair.\n    I\nonce did hold it, as our\nstatists do,\n    A baseness to\nwrite fair, and labour'd much\nHow to forget that learning;\nbut, sir, now  \n    It did me\nyeoman's service. Wilt thou know\nTh' effect of what I wrote?\nHor. Ay, good my lord.\n  Ham. An\nearnest conjuration from the\nKing,\n    As England was his\nfaithful tributary,\n    As love\nbetween them like the palm might\nflourish,\n    As peace should\nstill her wheaten garland wear\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their\namities,\n    And many such-like\nas's of great charge,\n    That,\non the view and knowing of these\ncontents,\n    Without debatement\nfurther, more or less,\n    He\nshould the bearers put to sudden\ndeath,\n    Not shriving time\nallow'd.\n  Hor. How was this\nseal'd?\n  Ham. Why, even in that\nwas heaven ordinant.\n    I had\nmy father's signet in my purse,\nwhich was the model of that\nDanish seal;\n    Folded the writ\nup in the form of th' other,\nSubscrib'd it, gave't th'\nimpression, plac'd it safely,\nThe changeling never known. Now,\nthe next day  \n    Was our sea-\nfight; and what to this was\nsequent\n    Thou know'st\nalready.\n  Hor. So Guildenstern\nand Rosencrantz go to't.\n  Ham.\nWhy, man, they did make love to\nthis employment!\n    They are\nnot near my conscience; their\ndefeat\n    Does by their own\ninsinuation grow.\n    'Tis\ndangerous when the baser nature\ncomes\n    Between the pass and\nfell incensed points\n    Of\nmighty opposites.\n  Hor. Why,\nwhat a king is this!\n  Ham. Does\nit not, thinks't thee, stand me\nnow upon-\n    He that hath\nkill'd my king, and whor'd my\nmother;\n    Popp'd in between\nth' election and my hopes;\nThrown out his angle for my\nProper life,\n    And with such\ncoz'nage- is't not perfect\nconscience\n    To quit him with\nthis arm? And is't not to be\ndamn'd\n    To let this canker of\nour nature come\n    In further\nevil?\n  Hor. It must be shortly\nknown to him from England\nWhat is the issue of the\nbusiness there.  \n  Ham. It will\nbe short; the interim is mine,\nAnd a man's life is no more than\nto say 'one.'\n    But I am very\nsorry, good Horatio,\n    That to\nLaertes I forgot myself,\n    For\nby the image of my cause I see\nThe portraiture of his. I'll\ncourt his favours.\n    But sure\nthe bravery of his grief did put\nme\n    Into a tow'ring passion.\nHor. Peace! Who comes here?\nEnter young Osric, a courtier.\nOsr. Your lordship is right\nwelcome back to Denmark.\n  Ham.\nI humbly thank you, sir. [Aside\nto Horatio] Dost know this\nwaterfly?\n  Hor. [aside to\nHamlet] No, my good lord.\n  Ham.\n[aside to Horatio] Thy state is\nthe more gracious; for 'tis a\nvice to know him. He hath much\nland, and fertile. Let a beast\nbe\n    lord of beasts, and his\ncrib shall stand at the king's\nmess. 'Tis\n    a chough; but, as\nI say, spacious in the\npossession of dirt.  \n  Osr.\nSweet lord, if your lordship\nwere at leisure, I should impart\na thing to you from his Majesty.\nHam. I will receive it, sir,\nwith all diligence of spirit.\nPut your\n    bonnet to his right\nuse. 'Tis for the head.\n  Osr. I\nthank your lordship, it is very\nhot.\n  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis\nvery cold; the wind is\nnortherly.\n  Osr. It is\nindifferent cold, my lord,\nindeed.\n  Ham. But yet methinks\nit is very sultry and hot for my\ncomplexion.\n  Osr. Exceedingly,\nmy lord; it is very sultry, as\n'twere- I cannot\n    tell how.\nBut, my lord, his Majesty bade\nme signify to you that\n    he\nhas laid a great wager on your\nhead. Sir, this is the matter-\nHam. I beseech you remember.\n[Hamlet moves him to put on his\nhat.]\n  Osr. Nay, good my lord;\nfor mine ease, in good faith.\nSir, here is\n    newly come to\ncourt Laertes; believe me, an\nabsolute gentleman,\n    full of\nmost excellent differences, of\nvery soft society and\n    great\nshowing. Indeed, to speak\nfeelingly of him, he is the card\nor calendar of gentry; for you\nshall find in him the continent\nof\n    what part a gentleman\nwould see.\n  Ham. Sir, his\ndefinement suffers no perdition\nin you; though, I  \n    know, to\ndivide him inventorially would\ndozy th' arithmetic of\nmemory, and yet but yaw neither\nin respect of his quick sail.\nBut, in the verity of extolment,\nI take him to be a soul of great\narticle, and his infusion of\nsuch dearth and rareness as, to\nmake\n    true diction of him,\nhis semblable is his mirror, and\nwho else\n    would trace him,\nhis umbrage, nothing more.\nOsr. Your lordship speaks most\ninfallibly of him.\n  Ham. The\nconcernancy, sir? Why do we wrap\nthe gentleman in our more\nrawer breath\n  Osr. Sir?\n  Hor\n[aside to Hamlet] Is't not\npossible to understand in\nanother\n    tongue? You will\ndo't, sir, really.\n  Ham. What\nimports the nomination of this\ngentleman\n  Osr. Of Laertes?\nHor. [aside] His purse is empty\nalready. All's golden words are\nspent.\n  Ham. Of him, sir.\nOsr. I know you are not\nignorant-\n  Ham. I would you\ndid, sir; yet, in faith, if you\ndid, it would not\n    much\napprove me. Well, sir?  \n  Osr.\nYou are not ignorant of what\nexcellence Laertes is-\n  Ham. I\ndare not confess that, lest I\nshould compare with him in\nexcellence; but to know a man\nwell were to know himself.\nOsr. I mean, sir, for his\nweapon; but in the imputation\nlaid on him\n    by them, in his\nmeed he's unfellowed.\n  Ham.\nWhat's his weapon?\n  Osr. Rapier\nand dagger.\n  Ham. That's two of\nhis weapons- but well.\n  Osr.\nThe King, sir, hath wager'd with\nhim six Barbary horses;\nagainst the which he has\nimpon'd, as I take it, six\nFrench\n    rapiers and poniards,\nwith their assigns, as girdle,\nhangers, and\n    so. Three of\nthe carriages, in faith, are\nvery dear to fancy,\n    very\nresponsive to the hilts, most\ndelicate carriages, and of\nvery liberal conceit.\n  Ham.\nWhat call you the carriages?\nHor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew\nyou must be edified by the\nmargent\n    ere you had done.\nOsr. The carriages, sir, are the\nhangers.\n  Ham. The phrase would\nbe more germane to the matter if\nwe could\n    carry cannon by our\nsides. I would it might be\nhangers till then.  \n    But on!\nSix Barbary horses against six\nFrench swords, their\nassigns, and three liberal-\nconceited carriages: that's the\nFrench\n    bet against the\nDanish. Why is this all impon'd,\nas you call it?\n  Osr. The King,\nsir, hath laid that, in a dozen\npasses between\n    yourself and\nhim, he shall not exceed you\nthree hits; he hath\n    laid on\ntwelve for nine, and it would\ncome to immediate trial\n    if\nyour lordship would vouchsafe\nthe answer.\n  Ham. How if I\nanswer no?\n  Osr. I mean, my\nlord, the opposition of your\nperson in trial.\n  Ham. Sir, I\nwill walk here in the hall. If\nit please his Majesty,\n    it is\nthe breathing time of day with\nme. Let the foils be\nbrought, the gentleman willing,\nand the King hold his purpose,\nI will win for him if I can; if\nnot, I will gain nothing but my\nshame and the odd hits.\n  Osr.\nShall I redeliver you e'en so?\nHam. To this effect, sir, after\nwhat flourish your nature will.\nOsr. I commend my duty to your\nlordship.\n  Ham. Yours, yours.\n[Exit Osric.] He does well to\ncommend it\n    himself; there\nare no tongues else for's turn.\nHor. This lapwing runs away with\nthe shell on his head.  \n  Ham.\nHe did comply with his dug\nbefore he suck'd it. Thus has\nhe,\n    and many more of the\nsame bevy that I know the drossy\nage dotes\n    on, only got the\ntune of the time and outward\nhabit of encounter-\n    a kind\nof yesty collection, which\ncarries them through and\nthrough the most fann'd and\nwinnowed opinions; and do but\nblow\n    them to their trial-the\nbubbles are out,\nEnter a Lord.\n\n  Lord. My lord,\nhis Majesty commended him to you\nby young Osric, who\n    brings\nback to him, that you attend him\nin the hall. He sends to\nknow if your pleasure hold to\nplay with Laertes, or that you\nwill\n    take longer time.\nHam. I am constant to my\npurposes; they follow the King's\npleasure.\n    If his fitness\nspeaks, mine is ready; now or\nwhensoever, provided\n    I be so\nable as now.\n  Lord. The King\nand Queen and all are coming\ndown.\n  Ham. In happy time.\nLord. The Queen desires you to\nuse some gentle entertainment to\nLaertes before you fall to play.\nHam. She well instructs me.\n[Exit Lord.]\n  Hor. You will\nlose this wager, my lord.\n  Ham.\nI do not think so. Since he went\ninto France I have been in\ncontinual practice. I shall win\nat the odds. But thou wouldst\nnot\n    think how ill all's here\nabout my heart. But it is no\nmatter.\n  Hor. Nay, good my lord\n-\n  Ham. It is but foolery; but\nit is such a kind of gaingiving\nas\n    would perhaps trouble a\nwoman.\n  Hor. If your mind\ndislike anything, obey it. I\nwill forestall their\n    repair\nhither and say you are not fit.\nHam. Not a whit, we defy augury;\nthere's a special providence in\nthe fall of a sparrow. If it be\nnow, 'tis not to come', if it be\nnot to come, it will be now; if\nit be not now, yet it will come:\nthe readiness is all. Since no\nman knows aught of what he\nleaves,\n    what is't to leave\nbetimes? Let be.\n\n    Enter\nKing, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and\nLords, with other\nAttendants with foils and\ngauntlets.\n               A\ntable and flagons of wine on it.\nKing. Come, Hamlet, come, and\ntake this hand from me.\n[The King puts Laertes' hand\ninto Hamlet's.]\n  Ham. Give me\nyour pardon, sir. I have done\nyou wrong;\n    But pardon't, as\nyou are a gentleman.\n    This\npresence knows,\n    And you must\nneeds have heard, how I am\npunish'd\n    With sore\ndistraction. What I have done\nThat might your nature, honour,\nand exception\n    Roughly awake,\nI here proclaim was madness.\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?\nNever Hamlet.\n    If Hamlet from\nhimself be taken away,\n    And\nwhen he's not himself does wrong\nLaertes,\n    Then Hamlet does it\nnot, Hamlet denies it.\n    Who\ndoes it, then? His madness. If't\nbe so,\n    Hamlet is of the\nfaction that is wrong'd;\n    His\nmadness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\nSir, in this audience,\n    Let\nmy disclaiming from a purpos'd\nevil\n    Free me so far in your\nmost generous thoughts\nThat I have shot my arrow o'er\nthe house\n    And hurt my\nbrother.\n  Laer. I am satisfied\nin nature,\n    Whose motive in\nthis case should stir me most\nTo my revenge. But in my terms\nof honour\n    I stand aloof, and\nwill no reconcilement\n    Till\nby some elder masters of known\nhonour\n    I have a voice and\nprecedent of peace\n    To keep\nmy name ungor'd. But till that\ntime\n    I do receive your\noffer'd love like love,\n    And\nwill not wrong it.\n  Ham. I\nembrace it freely,\n    And will\nthis brother's wager frankly\nplay.\n    Give us the foils.\nCome on.\n  Laer. Come, one for\nme.\n  Ham. I'll be your foil,\nLaertes. In mine ignorance\nYour skill shall, like a star i'\nth' darkest night,\n    Stick\nfiery off indeed.\n  Laer. You\nmock me, sir.\n  Ham. No, by this\nbad.  \n  King. Give them the\nfoils, young Osric. Cousin\nHamlet,\n    You know the wager?\nHam. Very well, my lord.\nYour Grace has laid the odds o'\nth' weaker side.\n  King. I do\nnot fear it, I have seen you\nboth;\n    But since he is\nbetter'd, we have therefore\nodds.\n  Laer. This is too heavy;\nlet me see another.\n  Ham. This\nlikes me well. These foils have\nall a length?\nPrepare to play.\n  Osr. Ay, my\ngood lord.\n  King. Set me the\nstoups of wine upon that table.\nIf Hamlet give the first or\nsecond hit,\n    Or quit in\nanswer of the third exchange,\nLet all the battlements their\nordnance fire;\n    The King\nshall drink to Hamlet's better\nbreath,\n    And in the cup an\nunion shall he throw\n    Richer\nthan that which four successive\nkings\n    In Denmark's crown\nhave worn. Give me the cups;\nAnd let the kettle to the\ntrumpet speak,\n    The trumpet\nto the cannoneer without,\nThe cannons to the heavens, the\nheaven to earth,\n    'Now the\nKing drinks to Hamlet.' Come,\nbegin.\n    And you the judges,\nbear a wary eye.\n  Ham. Come on,\nsir.\n  Laer. Come, my lord.\nThey play.\n  Ham. One.\n  Laer.\nNo.\n  Ham. Judgment!\n  Osr. A\nhit, a very palpable hit.\nLaer. Well, again!\n  King. Stay,\ngive me drink. Hamlet, this\npearl is thine;\n    Here's to\nthy health.\n[Drum; trumpets sound; a piece\ngoes off [within].\n    Give him\nthe cup.\n  Ham. I'll play this\nbout first; set it by awhile.\nCome. (They play.) Another hit.\nWhat say you?\n  Laer. A touch, a\ntouch; I do confess't.\n  King.\nOur son shall win.\n  Queen. He's\nfat, and scant of breath.\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin,\nrub thy brows.  \n    The Queen\ncarouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\nHam. Good madam!\n  King.\nGertrude, do not drink.\n  Queen.\nI will, my lord; I pray you\npardon me.          Drinks.\nKing. [aside] It is the poison'd\ncup; it is too late.\n  Ham. I\ndare not drink yet, madam; by-\nand-by.\n  Queen. Come, let me\nwipe thy face.\n  Laer. My lord,\nI'll hit him now.\n  King. I do\nnot think't.\n  Laer. [aside] And\nyet it is almost against my\nconscience.\n  Ham. Come for the\nthird, Laertes! You but dally.\npray You Pass with your best\nviolence;\n    I am afeard You\nmake a wanton of me.\n  Laer. Say\nyou so? Come on.\nPlay.\n  Osr. Nothing neither\nway.\n  Laer. Have at you now!\n[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in\nscuffling, they\nchange rapiers, [and Hamlet\nwounds Laertes].\n  King. Part\nthem! They are incens'd.\n  Ham.\nNay come! again!\nThe Queen falls.  \n  Osr. Look\nto the Queen there, ho!\n  Hor.\nThey bleed on both sides. How is\nit, my lord?\n  Osr. How is't,\nLaertes?\n  Laer. Why, as a\nwoodcock to mine own springe,\nOsric.\n    I am justly kill'd\nwith mine own treachery.\n  Ham.\nHow does the Queen?\n  King. She\nsounds to see them bleed.\nQueen. No, no! the drink, the\ndrink! O my dear Hamlet!\n    The\ndrink, the drink! I am poison'd.\n[Dies.]\n  Ham. O villany! Ho!\nlet the door be lock'd.\nTreachery! Seek it out.\n[Laertes falls.]\n  Laer. It is\nhere, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art\nslain;\n    No medicine in the\nworld can do thee good.\n    In\nthee there is not half an hour\nof life.\n    The treacherous\ninstrument is in thy hand,\nUnbated and envenom'd. The foul\npractice\n    Hath turn'd itself\non me. Lo, here I lie,\n    Never\nto rise again. Thy mother's\npoison'd.\n    I can no more. The\nKing, the King's to blame.\nHam. The point envenom'd too?\nThen, venom, to thy work.\nHurts the King.\n  All. Treason!\ntreason!\n  King. O, yet defend\nme, friends! I am but hurt.\nHam. Here, thou incestuous,\nmurd'rous, damned Dane,\nDrink off this potion! Is thy\nunion here?\n    Follow my\nmother.\nKing dies.\n  Laer. He is justly\nserv'd.\n    It is a poison\ntemper'd by himself.\nExchange forgiveness with me,\nnoble Hamlet.\n    Mine and my\nfather's death come not upon\nthee,\n    Nor thine on me!\nDies.\n  Ham. Heaven make thee\nfree of it! I follow thee.\n    I\nam dead, Horatio. Wretched\nqueen, adieu!\n    You that look\npale and tremble at this chance,\nThat are but mutes or audience\nto this act,\n    Had I but time\n(as this fell sergeant, Death,\nIs strict in his arrest) O, I\ncould tell you-\n    But let it\nbe. Horatio, I am dead;\n    Thou\nliv'st; report me and my cause\naright  \n    To the unsatisfied.\nHor. Never believe it.\n    I am\nmore an antique Roman than a\nDane.\n    Here's yet some liquor\nleft.\n  Ham. As th'art a man,\nGive me the cup. Let go! By\nheaven, I'll ha't.\n    O good\nHoratio, what a wounded name\n(Things standing thus unknown)\nshall live behind me!\n    If\nthou didst ever hold me in thy\nheart,\n    Absent thee from\nfelicity awhile,\n    And in this\nharsh world draw thy breath in\npain,\n    To tell my story.\n[March afar off, and shot\nwithin.]\n    What warlike noise\nis this?\n  Osr. Young\nFortinbras, with conquest come\nfrom Poland,\n    To the\nambassadors of England gives\nThis warlike volley.\n  Ham. O, I\ndie, Horatio!\n    The potent\npoison quite o'ercrows my\nspirit.\n    I cannot live to\nhear the news from England,\nBut I do prophesy th' election\nlights  \n    On Fortinbras. He\nhas my dying voice.\n    So tell\nhim, with th' occurrents, more\nand less,\n    Which have\nsolicited- the rest is silence.\nDies.\n  Hor. Now cracks a noble\nheart. Good night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee\nto thy rest!\n[March within.]\n    Why does the\ndrum come hither?\n\n    Enter\nFortinbras and English\nAmbassadors, with Drum,\nColours, and Attendants.\nFort. Where is this sight?\nHor. What is it you will see?\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease\nyour search.\n  Fort. This quarry\ncries on havoc. O proud Death,\nWhat feast is toward in thine\neternal cell\n    That thou so\nmany princes at a shot\n    So\nbloodily hast struck.\nAmbassador. The sight is dismal;\nAnd our affairs from England\ncome too late.  \n    The ears\nare senseless that should give\nus bearing\n    To tell him his\ncommandment is fulfill'd\nThat Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern are dead.\n    Where\nshould We have our thanks?\nHor. Not from his mouth,\n    Had\nit th' ability of life to thank\nyou.\n    He never gave\ncommandment for their death.\nBut since, so jump upon this\nbloody question,\n    You from\nthe Polack wars, and you from\nEngland,\n    Are here arriv'd,\ngive order that these bodies\nHigh on a stage be placed to the\nview;\n    And let me speak to\nthe yet unknowing world\n    How\nthese things came about. So\nshall You hear\n    Of carnal,\nbloody and unnatural acts;\nOf accidental judgments, casual\nslaughters;\n    Of deaths put on\nby cunning and forc'd cause;\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes\nmistook\n    Fall'n on th'\ninventors' heads. All this can I\nTruly deliver.\n  Fort. Let us\nhaste to hear it,  \n    And call\nthe noblest to the audience.\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my\nfortune.\n    I have some rights\nof memory in this kingdom\nWhich now, to claim my vantage\ndoth invite me.\n  Hor. Of that I\nshall have also cause to speak,\nAnd from his mouth whose voice\nwill draw on more.\n    But let\nthis same be presently\nperform'd,\n    Even while men's\nminds are wild, lest more\nmischance\n    On plots and\nerrors happen.\n  Fort. Let four\ncaptains\n    Bear Hamlet like a\nsoldier to the stage;\n    For he\nwas likely, had he been put on,\nTo have prov'd most royally; and\nfor his passage\n    The\nsoldiers' music and the rites of\nwar\n    Speak loudly for him.\nTake up the bodies. Such a sight\nas this\n    Becomes the field\nbut here shows much amiss.\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.\nExeunt marching; after the which\na peal of ordnance\nare shot off.  \n\n\nTHE END",
    "Shall I compare thee to a\nsummer’s day?\nThou art more\nlovely and more temperate:\nRough\nwinds do shake the darling buds\nof May,\nAnd summer’s lease hath\nall too short a date:\nSometime\ntoo hot the eye of heaven\nshines,\nAnd often is his gold\ncomplexion dimmed;\nAnd every\nfair from fair sometime\ndeclines,\nBy chance, or nature’s\nchanging course, untrimmed:\nBut\nthy eternal summer shall not\nfade,\nNor lose possession of\nthat fair thou ow’st;\nNor shall\nDeath brag thou wander’st in his\nshade\nWhen in eternal lines to\ntime thou grow’st:\nSo long as\nmen can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this\ngives life to thee.",
